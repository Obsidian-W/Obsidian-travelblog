Packing for backpacking is always the same story.  
You think you haven't enough, but you have.

The lighter you go, the happier you’ll be on hikes or in between hostels.  
Here’s my take on the **what to bring**, the bare essentials to get started. 

---

## Clothes

- One week worth of clothes, max. I do a load of laundry every week.  
- One warmer layer (hoodie, fleece, whatever) for nights or higher altitudes.  
- Underwear and socks can get dirty fast, bring enough to rotate.  
- Shoes: one solid pair for walking, eventually flip flops or something similar.
- Try having similar colors, it's easier for washing machines (unless you want a pink shirt)
- Sunglasses / Cap

> Note: Everybody wear the same clothes a couple time, if you don't sweat too much, use a t-shirt for two days.
If you can't wash a cloth right away, air dry it so it remains 'fresh', then pack it aside your other clothes.
Drink enough water, you don't want to have sweat touching your clothes, otherwise they will smell.
Showers twice a day if possible, it also help maintaining clean clothes.

## Sleep & Comfort

- Sleeping mask: lifesaver in planes and buses, useful in busy hostels, doesn't take any space.  
- Earplugs: obvious, unless your are Hearing Impaired like me, you might need them.  
- Lightweight towel: Dries fast and doesn’t take too much space. Useful as a spare.

## Health & Hygiene

- Wet wipes: Replace TP or showers when camping.  
- Antibacterial gel: use it often, especially before eating. If going to India, you'll have to resupply along the way.  
- Bandaids and sterile compresses: I seldom use them for myself, but I saved a few with them.  
- Diarrhea medication: Looking for your usual medication in a foreign country isn't fun, don't let that ruin your trip.  
- Dry soap and shampoo: small, doesn’t leak, often ecological.  
- Toothbrush and toothpaste: Don't be that guy.
- File/Nail trimmer.

## Electronics

- USB cables, at least two, just in case.
- Power bank: for those long journeys when your phone dies at 12%.  
- Adapter: You can find universal blocks online, some even charge multiple devices at once.
- Reader: A Kindle or a Kobo are nice things to have, lighter than books and they last a while
- Earphones: Don't be that guy.

## Other

- A sewing kit. 
- A pen. Bloody useful for customs forms and border crossings.  
- Foldable hiking poles: Ok, that take some space, but as I'm getting older, I'm becoming more fragile while going down slopes. It's also useful when hiking above 5000 meters.
- Sun screen.

## The Rule

If you’re hesitating about packing something: don’t.  
You can buy almost anything on the road, usually cheaper than at home.  

Pack light, keep it simple, and remember that every extra kilo feels like ten after a week.
