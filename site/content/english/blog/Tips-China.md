> This list has been compiled thanks to repeated travel in China.
It sums up the tools and tricks that actually make a difference when moving around the country.

(No shame: I used ChatGPT for quick formatting and some of the content)

## Essential Apps & Tools

### AMAP  
- It's available in English, even on Android now (yay).  
- Works much better than Google Maps in mainland China.  
- Rather accurate for walking, buses, and metro.  
- Stations are detailed down to exits and entrances.
- It's wonky at times and there are untranslated parts.

### Google Translate  
- /!\ Download the Chinese language before arriving.  
- The camera function is useful for menus and signs (It understandmy english better than my french!?).  
- Conversation mode works decently for simple interactions, but I prefer to use the one in Alipay.

### VPNs  
- Most of our sites (Google, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube…) are blocked.  
- Install a VPN **before** entering China. LetsVPN and Astrill are common choices (I couldn't get Windscribe or Google's VPN to work).  
- Some work better than others depending on the region, so it’s worth having a backup.
- If you have a foreign sim card with data in China, then there's **probably** no need for a VPN.

> My French SIM Card with Free Mobile has 30 GB of data in China and let me use Whatsapp, Reddit and more without a VPN
But the downside is that, with this one, I don't have internet in France.
Since I switched to a better provider, I had to say goodbye to those benefits

## Transportation

### Booking Trains  
- Trains are the easiest way to move around (And are often cheap).  
- **Trip.com** offers English booking, accepts foreign cards, and often has competitive prices.  
- You’ll receive a QR code or pick-up code.  
- A passport is required for every booking and at the station (They check...).

### Using Didi  
- Equivalent of Uber, but cheap.  
- The app has an English interface and can be use through Alipay.  
- Payment works with foreign cards or through Alipay.

## Payments

### Alipay
- QR code payments, anytime, anywhere.  
- Non chinese citizen can link their bank card on it (needs a passport).  
- If linking fails, apparently, there is a “Tour Pass” option you can top up. I never tried.  

### WeChat
- Requires a stupid verification using chinese friend.  
- You can get banned anytime for no reason.
- It's a shitty app, I hate it.
- Payment with foreign cards is unreliable, but it’s still useful for messaging.
- I use Rednote for messaging now, it's fine.

## Other Notes

- **Cash**: Be prepared to receive weird looks. I usually avoid paying by cash  
- **Trains vs flights**: For distances under 1,000 km, trains are faster overall.  
- **Toilets**: Widespread but basic; carry tissues and sanitizer.  
- **Etiquette**: Avoid politics, queue firmly, stay polite and calm at all time, Thai style: Don't lose face.  
- Don't speak about you-know-what. Don't.
- Never carry a lighter, don't take pictures of flags, military installations or anything that could be sensitive
- **Photos**: Some government employees can ask to check your phone, some flags and previous leaders of long-gone countries (And an empire) are forbidden.
- **People taking pictures**: Chinese love to take pictures of foreigners. I don't wanna know what they do with them... *Insert Larry.webp*
