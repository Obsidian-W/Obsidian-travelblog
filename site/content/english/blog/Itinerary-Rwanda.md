## Day 1 Road to Kigali

Cross the border at **Katuna**.  
Smooth and organized.  
Arrive in **Kigali** by afternoon; it's clean, hilly and calm.
I decided to relax.

## Day 2 Kigali

![kigali](images/blog/rwanda2.jpg)

Visit the **Genocide Memorial**, check a cafe or eat some Rolex (Rolled eggs) and the see the conference center.  

The city is spotless and easy to navigate with moto-taxis.
Be warned, the memorial is hardcore.

There aren't many things to see in Kigali, but I love it.

> of those who survived the genocide, it explains things nicely

## Day 3 Ruhengeri

Bus north (3h30 min).  
Gateway to **Volcanoes National Park**.  
Cooler weather, nice mountain views, but nothing else; Do what you can with your free time,
I decided to read, play video games and eat in restaurants.

## Day 4 Volcanoes NP

![Volcanoes](images/blog/rwanda1.jpg)

Gorilla trekking if your budget allows and you want to support wildlife or...
See them for free by doing the caldera day hike.
If ya lucky, that's it. I met a traveler that did it the day before I did and had great pictures of gorillas.

> Careful of the gorilla scam, locals will tell you they have a way to see gorillas for "cheap".
> Apparently, there will never be gorillas. I don't fall into scams, so I didn't check.

---

## Day 5 Kibuye

Head south by bus (4h).  
**Kibuye** sits on **Lake Kivu**, full of islands and fishing boats.  
Great sunsets and peaceful evenings.

> If you have time, you can enjoy the Congo Nile trail, it was my original plan
> You walk for 5 days or more along the shore.
> It sounds a bit samey, but it might be nice.

## Day 6bis Congo Nile

Extend for how many days you like

## Day 6 Return to Kigali

Use the last day for shopping, coffee, or just resting before your flight.  
It's the end of the article and I'm getting lazy!
