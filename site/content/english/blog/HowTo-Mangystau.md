Mangystau is one of those names that you only hear once you start looking at Kazakhstan in detail (Or spend too much time on Insta like I do).  

Remote, harsh, desert-like, with landscapes that feel like nowhere else on Earth ‚Äî cliffs, white canyons, underground mosques, vast plateaus.  
It‚Äôs not the kind of place you just stumble upon, you need to actively plan for it and put it into your itinerary from the get-go.  

I went there on a three-day trip starting from **Aktau**, on the Caspian coast.  
To get to Aktau, I flew from Paris with a layover in Istanbul. It was the cheapest flight to Kazakhstan I could find, by the way.

## How to Visit Mangystau

Independent travel is technically possible, but unless you speak Russian or Kazakh, can drive long hours on bad tracks, and are ready to camp without support, it‚Äôs far easier to go with a local tour.  

I joined a small group tour with a local tour operator I found online prior to arrival.
We were six travelers split into two cars, with a driver each and the addition of a guide.
Those three were family, accustomed to work together and had all the necessary camping and cooking guide.

The driving time were so looooong and the road so confusing, I defo can't recommend going on your own. And don't even think about public transportation, there are barely any cities, and when there's one (or a village) you are still up to 100km away from something meaningful.
Due to this, you cannot do it on a true budget as well, you need üí∞üí∞
(I used RedMaya Travel btw, so I recommend them!)

## Food & Water

Meals were a mix of canteens and camp cooking.  
- **Canteens**: Simple Kazakh cuisine in big portions. Not too bad imho.  
- **Camp meals**: Far better than I expected!, It was filling and varied (as camp-cooking goes),  
- **Extras**: Bring snacks along the way, sharing is caring.

They even managed to accommodate food allergies, which is nice!

## Sights & Walking

The main reason you come here: the landscapes.  
I won‚Äôt spoil every stop, but highlights include **Bozjyra Canyon**, **Torysh (Valley of ùìëùì™ùìµùìµùìº)**, underground mosques, and surreal plateaus that stretch to the horizon.  

Three days is enough to see the main sites at a **good pace**, four days would be overkill, two would be boring. Hence I think three is just right.  
I walked between 7 and 14 km each day, though you could walk less, I just prefer exploring on foot once on-site and so did my group (be careful of the heat, it's painfully hot in July).  

In the end, the rhythm works: long drives, stops to hike and look around, camping under a sky full of stars.

## Guiding & Driving

Our guide was knowledgeable, talkative, and very Kazakh in spirit. He added depth to the journey beyond the sights (Thanks ChatGPT for that nice sentence).  

The two drivers handled rough roads and sand tracks without issue. Communication was slower with them, as their English was limited, but everything ran smoothly.

## Cost

Mangystau isn‚Äôt a budget trip.  
Tours are on the expensive side, especially compared to other parts of Kazakhstan.  
That said, you‚Äôre paying for two drivers, one guide, proper 4x4 vehicles, fuel, camping gear (tents are usually single-use, one per person), and full logistical support.  

For three full days, the price made sense, especially since there isn't that much demand yet.

## Practical Notes

- **Best time to go**: Spring and autumn. Summers can be brutally hot, winters are cold and windy.  
- **Packing**: Layers, good shoes for walking on rocks and sand, sunscreen, a hat.  
- **Connectivity**: Mobile coverage is almost non-existent in the desert.  
- **Toilets**: Wild camping = wild toilets. Don‚Äôt expect facilities.  
- **Sleep**: Be prepared to camp. It'll be windy.

## Where to Next?

Mangystau fits into a wider trip across Kazakhstan or Central Asia. From Aktau, you can continue in several directions:  

- **Astana**: Direct flights from Aktau, usually the fastest way (That's what I did!)  
- **Almaty**: Flights exist, but if you prefer trains, be ready for a very long journey, ie: over 2,500 km, and 24h, or so I've heard.  
- **Uzbekistan**: There are trains south from Aktau toward Beyneu, where you can connect onwards to Nukus (in Karakalpakstan,). This is a good option if you want to see the ship graveyard and head towards the silk road.  
- **Istanbul**: Flights are common, I came through Istanbul, Kebabistan.
- **Tblissi**: A lot of flights as well, it might be a decent option.
