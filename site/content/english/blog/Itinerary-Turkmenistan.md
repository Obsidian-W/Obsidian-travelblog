## Day 1 Konye

First thing first, find your way in the country.
I started from Uzbekitan. The logical road used to be UZ-TM-IR
nowadays, it's only possible to go from UZ to TM.
So I went to the Shavat border in Uzbekistan, taking a shared taxi from Khiva
One hour later I was at the border, filled with Turkmen coming home with their
shopping (TVs, PS4, computer stuff, air fryers...).

After a very long and stupid trip (you have to pay a bus to cross 200m through the No man's land),
I reached the Turkmen outpost, met my guide, Ruslan there.
Here are his info:

> (He's aware I'm putting his contact info here, I asked for permission. I'm not gaining anything from this)

After paying the necessary 100$ or something for the visa, entry and covid test, I was in!

> The price is not the same for everyone, check with your guide and our nationality
> Also, carry a lot of cash with fresh USD notes, it's mandatory

So, yeah, I got in the country, my guide met me at the border, we got a driver and went all the way
to Konye Urgench to see the ruins.
Felt a bit meh compared to Uzbekistan, much more ruined and spread out.
It's still nice for history buffs, especially when doing a guided tour, thing I didn't do back in UZ.

After Konye, we went to Darva- not. Back to the border town of Dashoguz.
Yup, the road to Darvaza is not finished from Konye, so enjoy the long detour.

Finally, after a bumpy road that was dreadful, I arrived at Darvaza, the gates of Hell!

We visited at night to see the beautiful flames and the stars.

See the pictures:

Nice isn't it?

## Day 2 Darvaza

> This is a bit mixed with the previous day, sorry.

(After a barbecue and some wildlife spotting, I slept in a Yurt near the crater until sunrise.
The Darvaza crater during the day is quite a worrying sight, dying out and not much to boast.
The gates to Hell are soon to be just a hole in the desert.

Anyaway, we continued, seeing other craters on the way as well as the sand dunes, through the bumpy road.
To where? Ashgabat of course.

A city of white marble, of elegance, of rules (And of a ruler), dazzling in the desert.
Ashgabat is only missing Aladdin and his flying carpet to be complete.

I thoroughly enjoyed the visit, mostly by car, to the grand buildings and all the center of interests.
Everything is so spread apart and most of the touristic attractions are actually outside of the lively city.
It's not a ghost town, just that most things you see on the internet are located near government buildings
and near a soon-to-be forest.

At night, the city is also quite lively, I walked freely, met some people, spoke with soldiers, shook I don't know
how many hands, said hi to everyone and well... just enjoyed the city by myself

## Day 3 Ashgabat

Depending on you tour, you may have more time to have an in depth visit of Ashgabat.
I think it's worth it.
The mosque is beautiful and the acoustic is incredible, it's nice to see the busy train station,
the roundabouts deserve their own tour, the indoor ferris wheel is stupid, the marriage center
might be where you will find a bride, the station, a bribe...
The commercial centers are nice for shopping too, shop for the dried apricots, they are lovely
(Best I had so far).

On your way out, admire the airport built like a bird and enjoy the cheap, fixed rate, flights to europe and more.
I went Ashgabat-Milano as Paris is not deserved since covid, it was inexpensive for the quality, the only
downside was the 100â‚¬ bus to go back home. One hundred for a bus, sheesh, what a bunch of loonies.
Turkmenistan > Italy.


- That's it folk. That was a short article, I know. I'm open to edit it if needed.
