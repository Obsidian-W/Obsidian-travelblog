Safaris have a reputation for being insanely expensive.  
I'll tell you how to afford it easily.

So... yes, if you go with those big international tour companies, you’ll be quoted thousands.  
But if you’re flexible and book locally, you can get a proper multi-day safari for a fraction of that.  

> Note that everyone pays something different, be discreet about how much you pay, apparently it can cause trouble amongst guests.

## The Basics

- **Last-minute works**: Agencies in safari towns (Arusha in Tanzania, Nairobi in Kenya, etc.) always have space to fill. Walk in, ask around, you’ll find a deal.  
- **Budget**: You can realistically get **three days for under 400 €**. That usually includes park fees, guide, car, fuel, accommodation (camping or budget lodges), and food. 
- **Group tours**: Cheaper if you join others instead of booking private. Groups are usually 4–6 people per car.  

> Note: I went in 2023, prices must have hiked up. Expect 450 or even 500€, inflation is a bitch.

## Where to Book

Local agencies are the key.  
For example, in **Arusha (Tanzania)**, there’s an agency literally next to the *Arusha Backpackers Hostel*. I walked in and had a tour booked within hours.  
Otherwise, it's Africa, everyone knows a guy. People will even approach you, just wait and pick the best option, lol.

## Practical Tips

- **SIM card first**: As soon as you land, get a local SIM. Makes it easier to coordinate with agencies, guides, and fellow travelers. And for safety. You might need it. Believe me.
- **What to bring**: Warm clothes for nights, sunglasses, sunscreen, power bank, and a decent camera if you care about photos.  
- **Food & water**: Usually included, but it’s smart to have extra snacks.

## Is it Worth It?

Absolutely. Even on a budget trip, you still see the same lions, elephants, giraffes, and endless savannahs as the people who paid ten times more.  
The only difference: they’re sipping wine in a lodge at night, and you’re in a tent.  
For me, that trade-off is more than fine.  

However, truth be told, sometimes it feels a bit "on rail". It was like going to the Thoiry Zoo near Paris, seeing one animal after the other in a way that was crafter by the guide. I was tired on the third day, it felt a bit too similar. I'm not that crazy about wildlife, so it checks out.
