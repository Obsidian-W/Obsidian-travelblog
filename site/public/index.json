[{"categories":["Tips","How-to"],"contents":"Packing for backpacking is always the same story.\nYou think you haven\u0026rsquo;t enough, but you have.\nThe lighter you go, the happier you’ll be on hikes or in between hostels.\nHere’s my take on the what to bring, the bare essentials to get started.\nClothes One week worth of clothes, max. I do a load of laundry every week. One warmer layer (hoodie, fleece, whatever) for nights or higher altitudes. Underwear and socks can get dirty fast, bring enough to rotate. Shoes: one solid pair for walking, eventually flip flops or something similar. Try having similar colors, it\u0026rsquo;s easier for washing machines (unless you want a pink shirt) Sunglasses / Cap Note: Everybody wear the same clothes a couple time, if you don\u0026rsquo;t sweat too much, use a t-shirt for two days. If you can\u0026rsquo;t wash a cloth right away, air dry it so it remains \u0026lsquo;fresh\u0026rsquo;, then pack it aside your other clothes. Drink enough water, you don\u0026rsquo;t want to have sweat touching your clothes, otherwise they will smell. Showers twice a day if possible, it also help maintaining clean clothes.\nSleep \u0026amp; Comfort Sleeping mask: lifesaver in planes and buses, useful in busy hostels, doesn\u0026rsquo;t take any space. Earplugs: obvious, unless your are Hearing Impaired like me, you might need them. Lightweight towel: Dries fast and doesn’t take too much space. Useful as a spare. Health \u0026amp; Hygiene Wet wipes: Replace TP or showers when camping. Antibacterial gel: use it often, especially before eating. If going to India, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to resupply along the way. Bandaids and sterile compresses: I seldom use them for myself, but I saved a few with them. Diarrhea medication: Looking for your usual medication in a foreign country isn\u0026rsquo;t fun, don\u0026rsquo;t let that ruin your trip. Dry soap and shampoo: small, doesn’t leak, often ecological. Toothbrush and toothpaste: Don\u0026rsquo;t be that guy. File/Nail trimmer. Electronics USB cables, at least two, just in case. Power bank: for those long journeys when your phone dies at 12%. Adapter: You can find universal blocks online, some even charge multiple devices at once. Reader: A Kindle or a Kobo are nice things to have, lighter than books and they last a while Earphones: Don\u0026rsquo;t be that guy. Other A sewing kit. A pen. Bloody useful for customs forms and border crossings. Foldable hiking poles: Ok, that take some space, but as I\u0026rsquo;m getting older, I\u0026rsquo;m becoming more fragile while going down slopes. It\u0026rsquo;s also useful when hiking above 5000 meters. Sun screen. The Rule If you’re hesitating about packing something: don’t.\nYou can buy almost anything on the road, usually cheaper than at home.\nPack light, keep it simple, and remember that every extra kilo feels like ten after a week.\nComments?

Amidst those big cities, patches of rewarding nature! I went for around a week back in April 2025, mainly to eat as much as possible (My love for dumplings will last till I die) and see Hong Kong, one of Asia\u0026rsquo;s most interesting city; In the end, I had a memorable trip!\nBefore diving into my itinerary, a few considerations:\nIt\u0026rsquo;s fine to start in any of the major airport, you can either do a \u0026rsquo;line\u0026rsquo; or a loop. For a line, the best starting and ending points are Hong Kong and Guangzhou Hong Kong is not really China, the one country two systems policy still remains, hence Hong Kong has its own visa policy and rules. To survive in mainland China, Alipay and a translator apps are lifesavers. Cash is accepted, but annoying to use and find. AMAP is now in english, even on Android, it works very well in mainland China. Google Maps is better in HK Never speak abour politics. It\u0026rsquo;s touchy. I did it in 7 days, but 8 would have been better. Damn flight deals. I did a loop itinerary from/to Shenzhen as the flights were less than 100$ both ways from Phnom Penh, so I\u0026rsquo;ll keep that order, adapt to your situation ;)\nDay 1: Arrival in Shenzhen - Baoan If you arrive in Shenzhen, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure you land in Bao\u0026rsquo;an. So what\u0026rsquo;s the best place to visit on a first day?\nBao\u0026rsquo;An of course!\nI wanted to keep Shenzhen last as I arrived very early, so I actually skipped to Hong Kong by bus straight from the airport. To do that, I went to the tourist counter, they explained everything and sold me a transfer bus that left around 5AM to the island of Hong Kong. It\u0026rsquo;s super convenient! However I was super tired, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t as enjoyable to visit with half a decent night, hence I recommend spending an afternoon in Shenzhen before moving on to HK the next morning.\nMorning? A few kilometers from the airport, you have the Happy Harbour, a touristic area undergoing heavy development and a nice way to see Shenzhen. (You can also find the place under the name Baoan Binhai Cultural Park)\nThat\u0026rsquo;s also where you find the famous library, it\u0026rsquo;s in the commercial center, right in the middle.\nI suggest spending your morning/afternoon there, get some food, explore the Xiaomi shop, see the sculptures, see the sea and Shenzhen impressive skyline\u0026hellip; It\u0026rsquo;s a bit mid, but good as a first visit.\nYou can easily use two hours to see all, count three if you eat.\nAfternoon You have more time? Spend the rest of the day in Nantou\u0026rsquo;s old city to get this Old City Feel! The old cities of Nantou and Xin\u0026rsquo;An as well as a nice park, Zhongshan Park are right next to each other.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t have time, it\u0026rsquo;s ok. You can leave this for later if you return to Shenzhen.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easy to spend two to three hours seeing everything.\nDay 2: Hong Kong - North (Mong kok, TST \u0026amp; more) The bus from Shenzhen will drop you around Mong Kok, if you come from the airport, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to reach. It\u0026rsquo;s also an area wth plenty of accomodation.\nFret not if you\u0026rsquo;re further, the YHA is in Sham Shui Po, an easy trip by subway. If you\u0026rsquo;re poor like me, then it\u0026rsquo;s nice to be out of the center.\nMorning It\u0026rsquo;s time to walk!\nStart from the Wong Tai Sin Temple (metro by the same name), visit it and then make your way to the remnants of the densest neighborhood that used to be: Kowloon. Walk further to see the Nan Lian gardens and the Chi Lin nunnery and even further to hike a mountain! The viewpoints are many and so are the sights, eating opportunities and other cool stuff.\nIf you walked well, congrats, it\u0026rsquo;s now the (late) afternoon.\n(Late) Afternoon Lets go to Tsim Sha Tsui!\nSouth of this part of HK, you have another nice cluster: Nice buildings, the avenue of stars, the Bruce Lee statue and the harbor. There are plenty of museums as well, if that\u0026rsquo;s your thing. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty much bored out of them, so I visit sparingly.\nOnce night falls, be sure to see the drone show. If it\u0026rsquo;s not too late, or if you\u0026rsquo;re not tired yet, see Temple Street on the way back for a rewarding night market experience.\nDay 3: Hong Kong - Lantau Morning Let\u0026rsquo;s go get some greenery! To get to Lantau, the easiest way is to take the subway to Tung Chung. To get started for this day activity, you need to follow with a bus to Tian Tan Buddha. Those buses are near the man road, a bit north of the station, follow the tourists. This is the cheapest way to see the giant buddha and to start hiking Lantau Peak (934m according to Google), Lantau Peak is a good way to see the whole island.\nHence:\nI recommend walking around the Big Buddha, walk up the stairs, see the Po Lin Monastery then head out toward the hiking path; walking past the Wisdom path and its pillars, toward the hill and viewpoint over the island. Be prepared to walk quite a lot, with a terrain that is not that easy, I rolled my ankle on the way down, the next five days weren\u0026rsquo;t so fun. The picture for this section has been taken from the top.\nAfternoon From Ngong Ping Village (near the Buddha), there is a cable car station and a bus station. Early in the afternoon, there are buses every 30 minutes going to the Tai\u0026rsquo;O fishing village. That\u0026rsquo;s the destination.\nAccording to GMaps, bus number 21 is the only direct one, if you want to go down using the cable car, then you can use buses 1 and 11, it\u0026rsquo;s a 20 minutes drive.\nWalk around the market, spot the cats and eat delicious mochis! AThere is a promenade near the sea, a few nice shops (inexpensive compared to the rest of the country) and a marker. After that visit, it\u0026rsquo;ll probably be late, head back to Tung Chung by bus (Bus number 11) and zip back to mainland HK by subway (Orange line).\nFrom Tai\u0026rsquo;O, it\u0026rsquo;s easily two hours to get back to the center of Hong Kong\u0026hellip; Be prepared to be dead tired.\nDay 4: Hong Kong - Central Morning Now let\u0026rsquo;s explore the last important island of Hong Kong: Hong Kong Island (of course). The beautiful skyscrappers of the coastline, the monster building in Causeway Bay, the batteries and forts\u0026hellip; Just by going east along the coast, you have sights after sights. (I recommend taking the bus, it\u0026rsquo;s quite spread out, use and abuse it) If you like uncommon sights, you can go a bit further out and check out the Haw Par mansion or the Hong Kong movie archives (I haven\u0026rsquo;t been inside but the building is cool) Once I visited all of that I went to get some eggtarts from Bakehouse in Central (And to grab some lunch on the go)\nAfternoon If you too went to Bakehouse in Central, then you are near one of the main touristic area, the Central-Mid levels escalors and the main parts of Central. Enjoy the street art, the cool building and the escalator letting you go all the way to the base of Mount Victoria. And then\u0026hellip; It\u0026rsquo;s hiking time again.\nGo up the mountain for a good sunset/night view of the city! If you went up Lantau the previous day, without hurting youreslf like I did, then it should be fine. Even with one limping leg, I did it easily.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it for Hong Kong. If you have more time, then you can head to more museums, go shopping, see different viewpoints, see a horse race near Wan Chai, perhaps even go to Lamma Island\u0026hellip; If I were to be stranded one month in HK, I legit would never be bored!\nDay 5: Macau Morning Both Ferries and buses goes to Macau, I think I went with One Bus, but I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure, it\u0026rsquo;s been a while. There are two islands, drop your bags to your hotel in the right island!\nI started with Coloane, the southern island. Check out the casinos, the tram and, if by chance you have enough time, the Coloane village! I think it\u0026rsquo;s ok to visit until 3PM or something. Take your time. I didn\u0026rsquo;t visit Coloane Village, and I kinda regret, another traveler showed me pictures and it was hella cute. Instead I spent more time in the northern island and ended up rushing it a bit (Same as with Guangzhou)\nAfternoon Let\u0026rsquo;s go to the northern island. Start from A-Ma temple (at the tram\u0026rsquo;s terminus) and walk toward the center It\u0026rsquo;s as easy as that. On the way you have the Casa do Mandarim, a lot of portuguese churches, the Dom Pedro V theater, pastries\u0026hellip;\nThen, it\u0026rsquo;s time to see the Largo Do Senado, the Sao Paulo ruins and the Monte do Forte. That\u0026rsquo;s a lot!\nOnce night befell the skies, I headed east toward the casinos (such as the Lisboa, to get another night view. If you have more time, lucky you! Be sure to head to the Guia lighthouse while you have time (And see the San Lazaro district on the way)\nDon\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to add a day to spread it out, I walked more than 20 kilometers that day.\nDay 6: Guangzhou Morning Let\u0026rsquo;s go to Guangzhou.\nAnd take the train this time. Head north with a bus to Portas do Cerco (They also go round the island, ask around and see!), that\u0026rsquo;s the border. From there, after the crossing you get to a train station where you can use your remaining patacas before heading to Guangzhou.\nOnce in town, I recommend walk toward Yuexiu park starting form the Temple of Six Banyan Trees. From the temple go north to the Dr Sun Wat-Sen\u0026rsquo;s Memorial Hall then the Nanyue King Wen\u0026rsquo;s mausoleum.\nEat an early lunch before going to see the rest, otherwise you\u0026rsquo;re going to have a very late lunch.\nAfternoon Right after the mausoleum stands the big park hosting the famous ram statue and the Guangzhou museum an old building/viewpoint that is a cheap museum teaching about the city\u0026rsquo;s history and fights with pirates. Interesting and good for pictures! Before the dark replace the blue, use the metro to zap to the English district in Shamian. You can have a leisurely walk near colonial buildings, close to the river. In the late afternoon it\u0026rsquo;s busy in a good way. It does\u0026rsquo;t take too much time and allow you to see another side of the city.\nAfterwards, it should be around nightfall, head to the center to see the light show near the Guangzhou TV Tower, iirc it\u0026rsquo;s the Huacheng Plaza, the small island and then the new tower is across. An underground shuttle allow you to freely cross tehe river without worries, but there are a few bridges as well.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to use Didi to get to those places easily. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to find your way in the subway or to use the buses. I took more time than wanted to see the city because I walked too much and had too hard of a time finding my way. Hopefully, by now there are better transportation apps in english (AMAP was still in chinese only when I went\u0026hellip;)\nDay 7: Last day - Guangzhou/Shenzen Morning Use remaining time to finish the visit in Guangzou, I recommend to see the Shen Clan Ancestral Hall, but be sure to book in advance (online only) then head to the station and zip to Shenzhen. If you have time, the two parks neaer the Hall are both equally green and beautiful, it\u0026rsquo;s nice to take a break from the big city.\nAfternoon We are getting to the end of this article and i\u0026rsquo;m gtting Lazy. So refer to day 1 of Shenzhen and finish any unfinished business. Shopping, old town, the harbour, a hike\u0026hellip; There are many possibilities, but Shenzhen ain\u0026rsquo;t exactly a touristic city.\nDay X: With more days, ideas Too much time on your hands? Add a day for the casinos in Macau or spend one more night in Guangzhou to have more leisure!\nYou can also add a day in HK to hike, it\u0026rsquo;s a hiking paradise after all :)\nComments?

It sums up the tools and tricks that actually make a difference when moving around the country.\n(No shame: I used ChatGPT for quick formatting and some of the content)\nThere are no affiliations in this post, sadly. If any of the company mentioned here wishes to give me money, please do.\nEssential Apps \u0026amp; Tools AMAP It\u0026rsquo;s available in English, even on Android now (yay). Works much better than Google Maps in mainland China. Rather accurate for walking, buses, and metro. Stations are detailed down to exits and entrances. It\u0026rsquo;s wonky at times and there are untranslated parts. Google Translate /!\\ Download the Chinese language before arriving. The camera function is useful for menus and signs (It understandmy english better than my french!?). Conversation mode works decently for simple interactions, but I prefer to use the one in Alipay. VPNs Most of our sites (Google, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube…) are blocked. Install a VPN before entering China. LetsVPN and Astrill are common choices (I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get Windscribe or Google\u0026rsquo;s VPN to work). Some work better than others depending on the region, so it’s worth having a backup. If you have a foreign sim card with data in China, then there\u0026rsquo;s probably no need for a VPN. My French SIM Card with Free Mobile has 30 GB of data in China and let me use Whatsapp, Reddit and more without a VPN But the downside is that, with this one, I don\u0026rsquo;t have internet in France. Since I switched to a better provider, I had to say goodbye to those benefits\nTransportation Booking Trains Trains are the easiest way to move around (And are often cheap). Trip.com offers English booking, accepts foreign cards, and often has competitive prices. You’ll receive a QR code or pick-up code. A passport is required for every booking and at the station (They check\u0026hellip;). Using Didi Equivalent of Uber, but cheap. The app has an English interface and can be use through Alipay. Payment works with foreign cards or through Alipay. Payments Alipay QR code payments, anytime, anywhere. Non chinese citizen can link their bank card on it (needs a passport). If linking fails, apparently, there is a “Tour Pass” option you can top up. I never tried. WeChat Requires a stupid verification using chinese friend. You can get banned anytime for no reason. It\u0026rsquo;s a shitty app, I hate it. Payment with foreign cards is unreliable, but it’s still useful for messaging. I use Rednote for messaging now, it\u0026rsquo;s fine. Other Notes Cash: Be prepared to receive weird looks. I usually avoid paying by cash Trains vs flights: For distances under 1,000 km, trains are faster overall. Toilets: Widespread but basic; carry tissues and sanitizer. Etiquette: Avoid politics, queue firmly, stay polite and calm at all time, Thai style: Don\u0026rsquo;t lose face. Don\u0026rsquo;t speak about you-know-what. Don\u0026rsquo;t. Never carry a lighter, don\u0026rsquo;t take pictures of flags, military installations or anything that could be sensitive Photos: Some government employees can ask to check your phone, some flags and previous leaders of long-gone countries (And an empire) are forbidden.

Really.\nOnce you have it, you can apply for the visa itself. Prices vary a bit depending on your nationality, but expect around 55–85 USD for the visa fee, plus an additional 14 USD entry tax at the border.\nAs of September 2025, there is still a requirement for a COVID test at the border. Not only it\u0026rsquo;s fake, but it\u0026rsquo;s also 35 USD for the privilege.\nIn total, I gave 100$ with a crisp bill.\nThe Agency There are plenty of agencies out there, but I can personally recommend the one and only Ruslan Hydyrov from IndieGuide. He was reliable, quick to answer emails, and knows the system inside out. *\nContact:\nPhone: +993 61 67 22 66 Mail: ruslanhydyrov@gmail.com If you get in touch, tell him you come thanks to Tim Paris (that’s me). He’ll know.\nThe Border At the moment (September 2025), the only open land border for tourists is near Dashoguz, the Shavat crossing from Uzbekistan.\nIf you’re coming overland, you’ll likely cross from Khiva (Uzbekistan) into Turkmenistan.\nI took a Yandex shared with another traveler and found one in twenty minutes. It\u0026rsquo;s an hour drive, be prepared for a long wait and to have to give a bonus to your driver. I gave the equivalent of a very good meal as a bonus.\nFlights Flying in or out is possible, you have to book a flight through the official Turkmenistan Airlines website https://turkmenistanairlinestr.com/tr-TR\nFrom Ashgabat, there are direct flights to Istanbul, Milano, London and Frankfurt. Prices are low for Central Asia.\nTo go to Milano, I paid around 220€, a steal!\nSafety \u0026amp; Rules Turkmenistan has a reputation for being strict, but in reality it’s not as scary as you think.\nWalking at night in Ashgabat is totally fine. I did it without issues or hassle, despite me not having a guide. Safety is basically guaranteed: There are no crimes. Beards and long hair are fine, despite rumors of them being illegal. There is quite a lot of freedom, but avoid taking pictures of the military and other sensitive stuff. Internet is 99% blocked, you need a good VPN or to forget about using the internet. ATMs / Cost / Gifts There are no ATMs in the country, bring enough cash. Online transfers are painful, getting USD at the border or in Uzbekistan is hard, paying by visa is a no as well. BRING CASH.\nIt costs a lot. Tours are private, so the more you are, the cheaper it is. Expect to pay up to 200 USD a day.\nFor gifts: The dried apricots are to die for. I brought like half a kilo of them, I should have brought two.\nFinal Notes Turkmenistan is not an easy country to enter, but once inside, it’s a fascinating place.\nThe bureaucracy and fees are part of the package. If you prepare your documents, book through a good agency, and accept that things move at their own pace, you’ll be rewarded with one of the most unique trips you can have in Central Asia.\nBy the way here\u0026rsquo;s my itinerary: With the tour I did\nComments?

It was the cheapest flight to Kazakhstan I could find, by the way.\nHow to Visit Mangystau Independent travel is technically possible, but unless you speak Russian or Kazakh, can drive long hours on bad tracks, and are ready to camp without support, it’s far easier to go with a local tour.\nI joined a small group tour with a local tour operator I found online prior to arrival. We were six travelers split into two cars, with a driver each and the addition of a guide. Those three were family, accustomed to work together and had all the necessary camping and cooking guide.\nThe driving time were so looooong and the road so confusing, I defo can\u0026rsquo;t recommend going on your own. And don\u0026rsquo;t even think about public transportation, there are barely any cities, and when there\u0026rsquo;s one (or a village) you are still up to 100km away from something meaningful. Due to this, you cannot do it on a true budget as well, you need 💰💰 (I used RedMaya Travel btw, so I recommend them!)\nFood \u0026amp; Water Meals were a mix of canteens and camp cooking.\nCanteens: Simple Kazakh cuisine in big portions. Not too bad imho. Camp meals: Far better than I expected!, It was filling and varied (as camp-cooking goes), Extras: Bring snacks along the way, sharing is caring. They even managed to accommodate food allergies, which is nice!\nSights \u0026amp; Walking The main reason you come here: the landscapes.\nI won’t spoil every stop, but highlights include Bozjyra Canyon, Torysh (Valley of 𝓑𝓪𝓵𝓵𝓼), underground mosques, and surreal plateaus that stretch to the horizon.\nThree days is enough to see the main sites at a good pace, four days would be overkill, two would be boring. Hence I think three is just right.\nI walked between 7 and 14 km each day, though you could walk less, I just prefer exploring on foot once on-site and so did my group (be careful of the heat, it\u0026rsquo;s painfully hot in July).\nIn the end, the rhythm works: long drives, stops to hike and look around, camping under a sky full of stars.\nGuiding \u0026amp; Driving Our guide was knowledgeable, talkative, and very Kazakh in spirit. He added depth to the journey beyond the sights (Thanks ChatGPT for that nice sentence).\nThe two drivers handled rough roads and sand tracks without issue. Communication was slower with them, as their English was limited, but everything ran smoothly.\nCost Mangystau isn’t a budget trip.\nTours are on the expensive side, especially compared to other parts of Kazakhstan.\nThat said, you’re paying for two drivers, one guide, proper 4x4 vehicles, fuel, camping gear (tents are usually single-use, one per person), and full logistical support.\nFor three full days, the price made sense, especially since there isn\u0026rsquo;t that much demand yet.\nPractical Notes Best time to go: Spring and autumn. Summers can be brutally hot, winters are cold and windy. Packing: Layers, good shoes for walking on rocks and sand, sunscreen, a hat. Connectivity: Mobile coverage is almost non-existent in the desert. Toilets: Wild camping = wild toilets. Don’t expect facilities. Sleep: Be prepared to camp. It\u0026rsquo;ll be windy. Where to Next? Mangystau fits into a wider trip across Kazakhstan or Central Asia. From Aktau, you can continue in several directions:\nAstana: Direct flights from Aktau, usually the fastest way (That\u0026rsquo;s what I did!) Almaty: Flights exist, but if you prefer trains, be ready for a very long journey, ie: over 2,500 km, and 24h, or so I\u0026rsquo;ve heard. Uzbekistan: There are trains south from Aktau toward Beyneu, where you can connect onwards to Nukus (in Karakalpakstan,). This is a good option if you want to see the ship graveyard and head towards the silk road. Istanbul: Flights are common, I came through Istanbul, Kebabistan. Tblissi: A lot of flights as well, it might be a decent option. Comments?

Walk in, ask around, you’ll find a deal. Budget: You can realistically get three days for under 400 €. That usually includes park fees, guide, car, fuel, accommodation (camping or budget lodges), and food. Group tours: Cheaper if you join others instead of booking private. Groups are usually 4–6 people per car. Note: I went in 2023, prices must have hiked up. Expect 450 or even 500€, inflation is a bitch.\nWhere to Book Local agencies are the key.\nFor example, in Arusha (Tanzania), there’s an agency literally next to the Arusha Backpackers Hostel. I walked in and had a tour booked within hours.\nOtherwise, it\u0026rsquo;s Africa, everyone knows a guy. People will even approach you, just wait and pick the best option, lol.\nPractical Tips SIM card first: As soon as you land, get a local SIM. Makes it easier to coordinate with agencies, guides, and fellow travelers. And for safety. You might need it. Believe me. What to bring: Warm clothes for nights, sunglasses, sunscreen, power bank, and a decent camera if you care about photos. Food \u0026amp; water: Usually included, but it’s smart to have extra snacks. Is it Worth It? Absolutely. Even on a budget trip, you still see the same lions, elephants, giraffes, and endless savannahs as the people who paid ten times more.\nThe only difference: they’re sipping wine in a lodge at night, and you’re in a tent.\nFor me, that trade-off is more than fine.\nHowever, truth be told, sometimes it feels a bit \u0026ldquo;on rail\u0026rdquo;. It was like going to the Thoiry Zoo near Paris, seeing one animal after the other in a way that was crafter by the guide. I was tired on the third day, it felt a bit too similar. I\u0026rsquo;m not that crazy about wildlife, so it checks out.\nComments?

Do click on the links (destination name) to learn more!\nTanzania Day 1 Arrival in Arusha Most travelers land at Kilimanjaro Airport and reach Arusha by shuttle, some cross the border from Kenya (There are border transfer services, it last around 6 hours and it was an easy border. Be prepared to have a lot of people selling you stuff) And other takes a long bus from Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania\u0026rsquo;s capital. Apparently it\u0026rsquo;s a gruesome 10 hours. Otherwise, it\u0026rsquo;s a bit less than 3 hours from Moshi.\nI actually came by land from Moyale in Ethiopia. It took me two days and a half, in retrospect, that was a stupid move. (For those interested (???) I went Konso -\u0026gt; Yabelo -\u0026gt; Moyale -\u0026gt; Slept at the border -\u0026gt; Marsabit -\u0026gt; Nairobi -\u0026gt; Slept in the streets -\u0026gt; Arusha) I saw a lot of landscapes along the way and did encounter funny people, strange locals and saw tribes out and about, it\u0026rsquo;s part of the adventure.\nAnyway, use the afternoon to get oriented, withdraw a good amount of cash, VERY IMPORTANT TO DO buy a local SIM (Vodacom or Airtel), and check a few safari agencies. I like to do my \u0026ldquo;shopping\u0026rdquo; with local agencies, even though prices are pretty much aligned.\nMore tips here (I\u0026rsquo;m lazy, I won\u0026rsquo;t C-Paste my content): Tips for Cheap Safaris. Join a group with a local operator: it’s easy to arrange last minute, and you can get three-days safaris under 500€.\nArusha isn’t the prettiest city, there aren\u0026rsquo;t a lot of sights: a few Hindu temples, gardens and a couple of art centers; I\u0026rsquo;d say that it\u0026rsquo;s more than enough for an afternoon.\nWelcome to Africa btw.\nDay 2 Arusha – Safari (Tarangire) I went on a three days safari with the local agency linked to the Arusha Backpackers hostel, (I don\u0026rsquo;t remember the name), A Tunisian guy, Bessa - owner of the first hostel in Tunis helped me, out with the negociations. It\u0026rsquo;s always better negociating with a friend.\nSafaris starts early. Expect a long drive into Tarangire, a forested area famous for its elephants (see the picture). The day was kinda long, but it was a blast, very reminescent of Thoiry back home (it\u0026rsquo;s a drive-in Zoo). It was my first real safari and that was really exciting, I was beaming!\nYour guide will help you spot all the wildlife, but they will normally remain pretty far from the animals, especially if they are a licensed guide that respect this very same wildlife.\nI slept in a tent in a camp, where I listened to Jambo Bwana for the first time. It was fun and simple.\nThe big five can be spotted right from the first day, if ya lucky\nDay 3 Arusha – Safari (Ngorongoro) Wake up before sunrise to enter the Ngorongoro Crater.\nIt’s a long descent into a massive bowl of wildlife, in the coldest of morning. When I went it was overly misty: Visibility was shit. The first few hours were rough and we missed the migration by weeks, changes in weather patterns messed things up\u0026hellip;\nSee the picture for the view/weather. Not that bad, actually, right? We spotted wildlife every 5 minutes or something, it felt like a railshooter. Anyone played Pokemon Snap before? That\u0026rsquo;s the feeling.\nWe camped near the Crater\u0026rsquo;s rim. You can hear the animals at night, noice.\nFact: Technically, the Ngorongoro is part of the Serengeti, even though it\u0026rsquo;s a different NP\nFact 2: The name is supposedly the sound of a bell\nDay 4 Arusha – Safari (Manyara) Final day of my safari, visiting Lake Manyara National Park.\nFewer crowds and good birdlife + Monke. It was my less favorite. I got tired after the first few hours. Safaris are not for me, they get exhausting after a while/\nManyara is home to the tree climbing lions, have fun trying to spot them!\nDay 5 Road to Moshi In the morning, I went to see the waterfalls near Arusha. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t worth it, folks try to make you pay every half hour and they are boring. So\u0026hellip; Take a morning bus or shared minivan to Moshi (2–3 h).\nThey are easy to find near the main bus station in Arusha, people will propose you the bus even if you don\u0026rsquo;t ask anyway.\nThe town of Moshi sits at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro. That\u0026rsquo;s the target. If you\u0026rsquo;re lucky, you might see it in its full glory.\nI went in the later afternoon, it was a hard mistake. Always arrive at your destination during day time.\nStory time: I came at night, had no sim card (I forgot) and my hostel (Mad Vervet Moshi) was a junkie nest where someone kidnapped me and forcefully brought me to an hotel with naked guys. So\u0026hellip; Avoid, be careful, don\u0026rsquo;t go alone. Be safe. This is no joke.\nDay 6 Moshi Shaken by the event of the day before I just went on a half-day hike around Materuni Falls, at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro.\nI met a nice man, that helped me immensely and spent time with his family. A nice \u0026ldquo;tuk-tuk\u0026rdquo; driver with a heart of Gold. I also switched hotel and found a safer place.\nStory time 2: I had been with the police the night before. Had a contact with them, but they were off. In a restaurant, far from the crime, Another policeman talked to me, heard about the case, gave me his phone number and all. Said it was just in case, to keep me safe, as the police deals in dark trades. Actually, he just wanted to you-know-what. I had to block him due to the almost nude pictures of himself he sent me. Thrice. He called with different numbers and tried to find me in the city.\nDay 7 Road to Lushoto I took a bus, early in the morning, trying to escape the dense gay policeman.\nIt was a long ride (6–7 h) through the mountains toward Lushoto in the Usambara Hills.\nThat part of my trip is blurry. I can\u0026rsquo;t recall much. I slept in a new hostel by the road, a bit higher than the town. A man named Emanuel and his family settled there and do honey keeping. I shared meals with them as well as watch a few show on the local TV.\nDay 8 Lushoto A view of Lushoto from the heights\nI Spent the day hiking to the Irente Viewpoint. The trail was nice, going through nature fror some bits and through local villages with nice kids greeting you at every opportunity. All of this was still a blur for me.\nDay 9 Road to Zanzibar Dar-Es-Salaam seen from the dock\nI caught a morning bus toward Dar es Salaam (6 hours?), then the ferry to Zanzibar (2 hours?).\nTo get the bus, I asked Emmanuel, the hostel owner to call the company and they picked me up in front of the hostel. It was super late and took forever to reach Dar, more than it was supposed to. I arrived around 3:30/4:00 PM and caught a ferry by taking a motorbike from the first bus station, I was scared of being late\u0026hellip; But, I made it in time, with half an hour of earliness to validate my ticket and everything.\nCareful at the docks, there are many places selling fake tickets, hundreds of scammers and weirdoes. I had to fight my way through, it was physical.\nThe trip is relaxing and comfy, the waves hadn\u0026rsquo;t started yet. Expect to arrive by evening to visit the beautiful Stone Town after dark; it\u0026rsquo;s safer and lively.\nDay 10 Stone Town The dispensary in Old town, it\u0026rsquo;s a medical center\nExplore the maze of Stone Town by daylight: the Old Fort, the markets, and the sea promenade.\nI ate at Forodhani Gardens, where locals grill food every night, it\u0026rsquo;s overrated. For lunch I went to a local shop and had much better food. Small hole in the wall without a name. Ate there for most meals afterwards.\nI recommend seeing the Jail for some hardcore history, the fort to see the activities (it\u0026rsquo;s lively), the palaces, eventually Freddy Mercury house, and\u0026hellip; just enjoy!\nI liked Stone Town quite a bit.\nI saw the sellers in the famous market shit behind their stall, close to the merchandise 🤮\nDay 11 Prison Island and Beach For the beach lovers\nTake a boat/tour to Prison Island to see the giant tortoises and the jail then spend the afternoon on one of the nearby sandbanks or beaches.\nI found a local agency at the fort with good tours, they were a blast to speak with (Jambo tour or smth like that) and where neatly organized.\n(If you want more comfort and relaxation, base yourself in Nungwi or Paje for the next days. I heard good things, except for the male prostitutes)\nDay 12 Spice Tour Join a spice tour inland! I went with the same tour company as the day before. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit touristy, but worth it for the smells and samples (Plus, I was alone, so I had my very own private tour to the farm) That\u0026rsquo;s a good half day spent for something important.\nIn the evening, hop on a small dhow boat for sunset and/or return to Dar. I did the later as my bus left very early.\nDay 13 Road to Kilwa Masoko Ferry back to Dar, then catch a southbound bus (8–9 h) toward Kilwa Masoko.\nThere were two bus to Kilwa: One leaves at 5:30, the other at noon. There might be other companies, but I have no intel on those. To get the bus I mototaxied to the station Mbagala Rangi Tatu and caught the bus at 7AM (Might have been late). At the bus station, there were those balls snacks that the Malagasy often make, it\u0026rsquo;s bloody delicious!\nThe road was long and without any major sight, everything looked the same until the azure coast. Onward it\u0026rsquo;s just villages, with a lovely pace of life.\nAfter a long time I reached the hostel: The Slow Leopard. Absolutely amazing quality! They also have another location in Dar, I definitely recommend it.\nI spent the evening relaxing and shopping for tours to Kilwa Kisiwani. I ended up going with the tourism information center, this was the most obvious choice.\nDay 14 Kilwa Kisiwani I\u0026rsquo;m bad at taking pictures, and the sun wasn\u0026rsquo;t nice to me.\nVisit the Kilwa Kisiwani ruins: once a major Swahili trading port and a World Wonder in Sid Meier\u0026rsquo;s Civilization VI. Yes, that\u0026rsquo;s why I went.\nWe got a boat for two (I met a scientist along the way) We were only two tourists!\nIt’s calm, scenic and pictures can\u0026rsquo;t do it justice\u0026hellip; It was expensive, quite a detour and exhausting, but I don\u0026rsquo;t regret it.\nDay 15 Kilwa Kivanje I visited the nearby Kilwas with the guide from the tourism bureau. It\u0026rsquo;s not particularily interesting, but I was a much cheaper visit and it was relaxing. I then spent the evening relaxing at the beach. You\u0026rsquo;ll need that before continuing your way south to Mozambique or back north to Kenya.\nDay 16 Back to Dar es Salaam Return north (6–7 h).\nIf you haven’t yet, explore Dar-Es-Salam a bit. I didn\u0026rsquo;t really like the city, it had no soul. But I had to waste a day here (So two days of transport wasted to See Kilwa, do what you want)\nDar is known for being a bit unsafe, be careful if visiting alone\nDay 17 Bagamoyo Short bus from Dar (1h 30 min).\nBagamoyo is a small coastal town with colonial buildings, it\u0026rsquo;s like Lamu or Tanga: A typical Swahili coast city.\nA quiet final stop before crossing into Kenya and a good way to slightly break the trip. To sleep, either: In Bagamoyo, back to Dar, or in Tanga, a bit more north.\nWhat did I do? I don\u0026rsquo;t know\u0026hellip; I relapsed a bit and the blur started again.\nDay 18 Road to Mombasa Early bus through Lunga Lunga border post.\nExpect an almost full-day ride and an arrival in Mombasa by evening.\nFind accommodation near the Old Town: There aren\u0026rsquo;t many places for backpackers. I found one on top of a restaurant, it was on GMaps, but I can\u0026rsquo;t find it anymore. It was held by a nice lady.\nSaw some people shitting in the streets in the middle of everything 🤮\nKenya Day 19 Mombasa Explore Fort Jesus, the Old Town’s narrow lanes, eat Swahili street food, see the thousands bats, the sculptures\u0026hellip;\nBut don\u0026rsquo;t take pictures of the government building, even though they are very Heritage, it\u0026rsquo;s forbidden.\nDay 20 Road to Nairobi Take the SGR train to Nairobi (6 h).\nBut be warned, the station security is airport like and it\u0026rsquo;s 10km out of town.\nPrepare to be there early!\nModern, air-conditioned, surprisingly punctual\u0026hellip; Relax and enjoy the scenery and the modernity.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re lucky, you can spot wildlife from your window, especially elephants, girafes and zebras.\nDay 21 Nairobi Arrive and get used to the city again.\nWalk around the center and see the National Museum.\nCareful, they will make you pay twice if you don\u0026rsquo;t pay attention, they took my card, swiped it twice, I got charged twice. They threw the other receipt in the bin, bunch of loosers.\nI slept at the YHA, it was full of weirdos and fanatics.\nThe streets were littered with people drugged out of their minds and some people tried to rob me. A lot of street harassment too\u0026hellip;\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re brave, visit. If you aren\u0026rsquo;t avoid.\nDay 22 Nairobi2 Book a half-day tour to Nairobi National Park, it’s right outside the city.\nOr see the giraffe mansion, the Karen Blixen Museum or whatever floats your boat.\nDay trips to the national parks outside of the Nairobi NP are crazy expansive. The Hell\u0026rsquo;s gate NP is like 150€+ for a day. Jesus Heckin\u0026rsquo; Christ.\nSpend the late afternoon preparing for the long road to Uganda. I took a night bus.\nUganda Day 23 Road to Kampala Bus north through the Busia border (12h +).\nDo take a night bus, it\u0026rsquo;s better.\nArrive in Kampala in the afternoon, visit the Gaddafi Mosque near the bus station or go to your hotel and visit whatever you want. It depends on your energy.\nKampala is crazy busy. Taking motorbike rides is especially crazy, no wonder there are a lot of road accidents and death. They call them boda-bodas here. But sometimes, I still say Tuk-Tuk.\nDay 24 Kampala Two options: Go to Jinja for rafting. Or, like me, visit the city a bit more in depth. I went to the Kasubi tombs, I checked viewpoints, ate some rolled eggs, saw the Hindu temple, rode Boda bodas at my life\u0026rsquo;s peril\u0026hellip;\nThe city is chaotic but friendly, but walking is suicidal.\nDay 25 Road to Fort Portal Early departure west (7–8 h).\nFort Portal is green, with views of the Rwenzori Mountains.\nThere isn\u0026rsquo;t much to see, so I ate and went further in the mountains, through a road in construction to get to my hostel.\nDay 26 Rwenzori Mountains Trek or hike shorter routes near the base.\nIf you’re not climbing fully, there are beautiful day trails around Ruboni Village.

Do click on the links (destination name) to learn more!\nTanzania Day 1 Arrival in Arusha Most travelers land at Kilimanjaro Airport and reach Arusha by shuttle, some cross the border from Kenya (There are border transfer services, it last around 6 hours and it was an easy border. Be prepared to have a lot of people selling you stuff) And other takes a long bus from Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania\u0026rsquo;s capital. Apparently it\u0026rsquo;s a gruesome 10 hours. Otherwise, it\u0026rsquo;s a bit less than 3 hours from Moshi.\nI actually came by land from Moyale in Ethiopia. It took me two days and a half, in retrospect, that was a stupid move. (For those interested (???) I went Konso -\u0026gt; Yabelo -\u0026gt; Moyale -\u0026gt; Slept at the border -\u0026gt; Marsabit -\u0026gt; Nairobi -\u0026gt; Slept in the streets -\u0026gt; Arusha) I saw a lot of landscapes along the way and did encounter funny people, strange locals and saw tribes out and about, it\u0026rsquo;s part of the adventure.\nAnyway, use the afternoon to get oriented, withdraw a good amount of cash, VERY IMPORTANT TO DO buy a local SIM (Vodacom or Airtel), and check a few safari agencies. I like to do my \u0026ldquo;shopping\u0026rdquo; with local agencies, even though prices are pretty much aligned.\nMore tips here (I\u0026rsquo;m lazy, I won\u0026rsquo;t C-Paste my content): Tips for Cheap Safaris. Join a group with a local operator: it’s easy to arrange last minute, and you can get three-days safaris under 500€.\nArusha isn’t the prettiest city, there aren\u0026rsquo;t a lot of sights: a few Hindu temples, gardens and a couple of art centers; I\u0026rsquo;d say that it\u0026rsquo;s more than enough for an afternoon.\nWelcome to Africa btw.\nDay 2 Arusha – Safari (Tarangire) I went on a three days safari with the local agency linked to the Arusha Backpackers hostel, (I don\u0026rsquo;t remember the name), A Tunisian guy, Bessa - owner of the first hostel in Tunis helped me, out with the negociations. It\u0026rsquo;s always better negociating with a friend.\nSafaris starts early. Expect a long drive into Tarangire, a forested area famous for its elephants (see the picture). The day was kinda long, but it was a blast, very reminescent of Thoiry back home (it\u0026rsquo;s a drive-in Zoo). It was my first real safari and that was really exciting, I was beaming!\nYour guide will help you spot all the wildlife, but they will normally remain pretty far from the animals, especially if they are a licensed guide that respect this very same wildlife.\nI slept in a tent in a camp, where I listened to Jambo Bwana for the first time. It was fun and simple.\nThe big five can be spotted right from the first day, if ya lucky\nDay 3 Arusha – Safari (Ngorongoro) Wake up before sunrise to enter the Ngorongoro Crater.\nIt’s a long descent into a massive bowl of wildlife, in the coldest of morning. When I went it was overly misty: Visibility was shit. The first few hours were rough and we missed the migration by weeks, changes in weather patterns messed things up\u0026hellip;\nSee the picture for the view/weather. Not that bad, actually, right? We spotted wildlife every 5 minutes or something, it felt like a railshooter. Anyone played Pokemon Snap before? That\u0026rsquo;s the feeling.\nWe camped near the Crater\u0026rsquo;s rim. You can hear the animals at night, noice.\nFact: Technically, the Ngorongoro is part of the Serengeti, even though it\u0026rsquo;s a different NP\nFact 2: The name is supposedly the sound of a bell\nDay 4 Arusha – Safari (Manyara) Final day of my safari, visiting Lake Manyara National Park.\nFewer crowds and good birdlife + Monke. It was my less favorite. I got tired after the first few hours. Safaris are not for me, they get exhausting after a while/\nManyara is home to the tree climbing lions, have fun trying to spot them!\nDay 5 Road to Moshi In the morning, I went to see the waterfalls near Arusha. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t worth it, folks try to make you pay every half hour and they are boring. So\u0026hellip; Take a morning bus or shared minivan to Moshi (2–3 h).\nThey are easy to find near the main bus station in Arusha, people will propose you the bus even if you don\u0026rsquo;t ask anyway.\nThe town of Moshi sits at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro. That\u0026rsquo;s the target. If you\u0026rsquo;re lucky, you might see it in its full glory.\nI went in the later afternoon, it was a hard mistake. Always arrive at your destination during day time.\nStory time: I came at night, had no sim card (I forgot) and my hostel (Mad Vervet Moshi) was a junkie nest where someone kidnapped me and forcefully brought me to an hotel with naked guys. So\u0026hellip; Avoid, be careful, don\u0026rsquo;t go alone. Be safe. This is no joke.\nDay 6 Moshi Shaken by the event of the day before I just went on a half-day hike around Materuni Falls, at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro.\nI met a nice man, that helped me immensely and spent time with his family. A nice \u0026ldquo;tuk-tuk\u0026rdquo; driver with a heart of Gold. I also switched hotel and found a safer place.\nStory time 2: I had been with the police the night before. Had a contact with them, but they were off. In a restaurant, far from the crime, Another policeman talked to me, heard about the case, gave me his phone number and all. Said it was just in case, to keep me safe, as the police deals in dark trades. Actually, he just wanted to you-know-what. I had to block him due to the almost nude pictures of himself he sent me. Thrice. He called with different numbers and tried to find me in the city.\nDay 7 Road to Lushoto I took a bus, early in the morning, trying to escape the dense gay policeman.\nIt was a long ride (6–7 h) through the mountains toward Lushoto in the Usambara Hills.\nThat part of my trip is blurry. I can\u0026rsquo;t recall much. I slept in a new hostel by the road, a bit higher than the town. A man named Emanuel and his family settled there and do honey keeping. I shared meals with them as well as watch a few show on the local TV.\nDay 8 Lushoto A view of Lushoto from the heights\nI Spent the day hiking to the Irente Viewpoint. The trail was nice, going through nature fror some bits and through local villages with nice kids greeting you at every opportunity. All of this was still a blur for me.\nDay 9 Road to Zanzibar Dar-Es-Salaam seen from the dock\nI caught a morning bus toward Dar es Salaam (6 hours?), then the ferry to Zanzibar (2 hours?).\nTo get the bus, I asked Emmanuel, the hostel owner to call the company and they picked me up in front of the hostel. It was super late and took forever to reach Dar, more than it was supposed to. I arrived around 3:30/4:00 PM and caught a ferry by taking a motorbike from the first bus station, I was scared of being late\u0026hellip; But, I made it in time, with half an hour of earliness to validate my ticket and everything.\nCareful at the docks, there are many places selling fake tickets, hundreds of scammers and weirdoes. I had to fight my way through, it was physical.\nThe trip is relaxing and comfy, the waves hadn\u0026rsquo;t started yet. Expect to arrive by evening to visit the beautiful Stone Town after dark; it\u0026rsquo;s safer and lively.\nDay 10 Stone Town The dispensary in Old town, it\u0026rsquo;s a medical center\nExplore the maze of Stone Town by daylight: the Old Fort, the markets, and the sea promenade.\nI ate at Forodhani Gardens, where locals grill food every night, it\u0026rsquo;s overrated. For lunch I went to a local shop and had much better food. Small hole in the wall without a name. Ate there for most meals afterwards.\nI recommend seeing the Jail for some hardcore history, the fort to see the activities (it\u0026rsquo;s lively), the palaces, eventually Freddy Mercury house, and\u0026hellip; just enjoy!\nI liked Stone Town quite a bit.\nI saw the sellers in the famous market shit behind their stall, close to the merchandise 🤮\nDay 11 Prison Island and Beach For the beach lovers\nTake a boat/tour to Prison Island to see the giant tortoises and the jail then spend the afternoon on one of the nearby sandbanks or beaches.\nI found a local agency at the fort with good tours, they were a blast to speak with (Jambo tour or smth like that) and where neatly organized.\n(If you want more comfort and relaxation, base yourself in Nungwi or Paje for the next days. I heard good things, except for the male prostitutes)\nDay 12 Spice Tour Join a spice tour inland! I went with the same tour company as the day before. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit touristy, but worth it for the smells and samples (Plus, I was alone, so I had my very own private tour to the farm) That\u0026rsquo;s a good half day spent for something important.\nIn the evening, hop on a small dhow boat for sunset and/or return to Dar. I did the later as my bus left very early.\nDay 13 Road to Kilwa Masoko Ferry back to Dar, then catch a southbound bus (8–9 h) toward Kilwa Masoko.\nThere were two bus to Kilwa: One leaves at 5:30, the other at noon. There might be other companies, but I have no intel on those. To get the bus I mototaxied to the station Mbagala Rangi Tatu and caught the bus at 7AM (Might have been late). At the bus station, there were those balls snacks that the Malagasy often make, it\u0026rsquo;s bloody delicious!\nThe road was long and without any major sight, everything looked the same until the azure coast. Onward it\u0026rsquo;s just villages, with a lovely pace of life.\nAfter a long time I reached the hostel: The Slow Leopard. Absolutely amazing quality! They also have another location in Dar, I definitely recommend it.\nI spent the evening relaxing and shopping for tours to Kilwa Kisiwani. I ended up going with the tourism information center, this was the most obvious choice.\nDay 14 Kilwa Kisiwani I\u0026rsquo;m bad at taking pictures, and the sun wasn\u0026rsquo;t nice to me.\nVisit the Kilwa Kisiwani ruins: once a major Swahili trading port and a World Wonder in Sid Meier\u0026rsquo;s Civilization VI. Yes, that\u0026rsquo;s why I went.\nWe got a boat for two (I met a scientist along the way) We were only two tourists!\nIt’s calm, scenic and pictures can\u0026rsquo;t do it justice\u0026hellip; It was expensive, quite a detour and exhausting, but I don\u0026rsquo;t regret it.\nDay 15 Kilwa Kivanje I visited the nearby Kilwas with the guide from the tourism bureau. It\u0026rsquo;s not particularily interesting, but I was a much cheaper visit and it was relaxing. I then spent the evening relaxing at the beach. You\u0026rsquo;ll need that before continuing your way south to Mozambique or back north to Kenya.\nDay 16 Back to Dar es Salaam Return north (6–7 h).\nIf you haven’t yet, explore Dar-Es-Salam a bit. I didn\u0026rsquo;t really like the city, it had no soul. But I had to waste a day here (So two days of transport wasted to See Kilwa, do what you want)\nDar is known for being a bit unsafe, be careful if visiting alone\nDay 17 Bagamoyo Short bus from Dar (1h 30 min).\nBagamoyo is a small coastal town with colonial buildings, it\u0026rsquo;s like Lamu or Tanga: A typical Swahili coast city.\nA quiet final stop before crossing into Kenya and a good way to slightly break the trip. To sleep, either: In Bagamoyo, back to Dar, or in Tanga, a bit more north.\nWhat did I do? I don\u0026rsquo;t know\u0026hellip; I relapsed a bit and the blur started again.\nComments?
