[{"categories":["Tips","How-to"],"contents":"Packing for backpacking is always the same story.\nYou think you haven\u0026rsquo;t enough, but you have.\nThe lighter you go, the happier you’ll be on hikes or in between hostels.\nHere’s my take on the what to bring, the bare essentials to get started.\nClothes One week worth of clothes, max. I do a load of laundry every week. One warmer layer (hoodie, fleece, whatever) for nights or higher altitudes. Underwear and socks can get dirty fast, bring enough to rotate. Shoes: one solid pair for walking, eventually flip flops or something similar. Try having similar colors, it\u0026rsquo;s easier for washing machines (unless you want a pink shirt) Sunglasses / Cap Note: Everybody wear the same clothes a couple time, if you don\u0026rsquo;t sweat too much, use a t-shirt for two days. If you can\u0026rsquo;t wash a cloth right away, air dry it so it remains \u0026lsquo;fresh\u0026rsquo;, then pack it aside your other clothes. Drink enough water, you don\u0026rsquo;t want to have sweat touching your clothes, otherwise they will smell. Showers twice a day if possible, it also help maintaining clean clothes.\nSleep \u0026amp; Comfort Sleeping mask: lifesaver in planes and buses, useful in busy hostels, doesn\u0026rsquo;t take any space. Earplugs: obvious, unless your are Hearing Impaired like me, you might need them. Lightweight towel: Dries fast and doesn’t take too much space. Useful as a spare. Health \u0026amp; Hygiene Wet wipes: Replace TP or showers when camping. Antibacterial gel: use it often, especially before eating. If going to India, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to resupply along the way. Bandaids and sterile compresses: I seldom use them for myself, but I saved a few with them. Diarrhea medication: Looking for your usual medication in a foreign country isn\u0026rsquo;t fun, don\u0026rsquo;t let that ruin your trip. Dry soap and shampoo: small, doesn’t leak, often ecological. Toothbrush and toothpaste: Don\u0026rsquo;t be that guy. File/Nail trimmer. Electronics USB cables, at least two, just in case. Power bank: for those long journeys when your phone dies at 12%. Adapter: You can find universal blocks online, some even charge multiple devices at once. Reader: A Kindle or a Kobo are nice things to have, lighter than books and they last a while Earphones: Don\u0026rsquo;t be that guy. Other A sewing kit. A pen. Bloody useful for customs forms and border crossings. Foldable hiking poles: Ok, that take some space, but as I\u0026rsquo;m getting older, I\u0026rsquo;m becoming more fragile while going down slopes. It\u0026rsquo;s also useful when hiking above 5000 meters. Sun screen. The Rule If you’re hesitating about packing something: don’t.\nYou can buy almost anything on the road, usually cheaper than at home.\nPack light, keep it simple, and remember that every extra kilo feels like ten after a week.\nComments?

Amidst those big cities, patches of rewarding nature! I went for around a week back in April 2025, mainly to eat as much as possible (My love for dumplings will last till I die) and see Hong Kong, one of Asia\u0026rsquo;s most interesting city; In the end, I had a memorable trip!\nBefore diving into my itinerary, a few considerations:\nIt\u0026rsquo;s fine to start in any of the major airport, you can either do a \u0026rsquo;line\u0026rsquo; or a loop. For a line, the best starting and ending points are Hong Kong and Guangzhou Hong Kong is not really China, the one country two systems policy still remains, hence Hong Kong has its own visa policy and rules. To survive in mainland China, Alipay and a translator apps are lifesavers. Cash is accepted, but annoying to use and find. AMAP is now in english, even on Android, it works very well in mainland China. Google Maps is better in HK Never speak abour politics. It\u0026rsquo;s touchy. I did it in 7 days, but 8 would have been better. Damn flight deals. I did a loop itinerary from/to Shenzhen as the flights were less than 100$ both ways from Phnom Penh, so I\u0026rsquo;ll keep that order, adapt to your situation ;)\nDay 1: Arrival in Shenzhen - Baoan If you arrive in Shenzhen, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure you land in Bao\u0026rsquo;an. So what\u0026rsquo;s the best place to visit on a first day?\nBao\u0026rsquo;An of course!\nI wanted to keep Shenzhen last as I arrived very early, so I actually skipped to Hong Kong by bus straight from the airport. To do that, I went to the tourist counter, they explained everything and sold me a transfer bus that left around 5AM to the island of Hong Kong. It\u0026rsquo;s super convenient! However I was super tired, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t as enjoyable to visit with half a decent night, hence I recommend spending an afternoon in Shenzhen before moving on to HK the next morning.\nMorning? A few kilometers from the airport, you have the Happy Harbour, a touristic area undergoing heavy development and a nice way to see Shenzhen. (You can also find the place under the name Baoan Binhai Cultural Park)\nThat\u0026rsquo;s also where you find the famous library, it\u0026rsquo;s in the commercial center, right in the middle.\nI suggest spending your morning/afternoon there, get some food, explore the Xiaomi shop, see the sculptures, see the sea and Shenzhen impressive skyline\u0026hellip; It\u0026rsquo;s a bit mid, but good as a first visit.\nYou can easily use two hours to see all, count three if you eat.\nAfternoon You have more time? Spend the rest of the day in Nantou\u0026rsquo;s old city to get this Old City Feel! The old cities of Nantou and Xin\u0026rsquo;An as well as a nice park, Zhongshan Park are right next to each other.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t have time, it\u0026rsquo;s ok. You can leave this for later if you return to Shenzhen.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easy to spend two to three hours seeing everything.\nDay 2: Hong Kong - North (Mong kok, TST \u0026amp; more) The bus from Shenzhen will drop you around Mong Kok, if you come from the airport, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to reach. It\u0026rsquo;s also an area wth plenty of accomodation.\nFret not if you\u0026rsquo;re further, the YHA is in Sham Shui Po, an easy trip by subway. If you\u0026rsquo;re poor like me, then it\u0026rsquo;s nice to be out of the center.\nMorning It\u0026rsquo;s time to walk!\nStart from the Wong Tai Sin Temple (metro by the same name), visit it and then make your way to the remnants of the densest neighborhood that used to be: Kowloon. Walk further to see the Nan Lian gardens and the Chi Lin nunnery and even further to hike a mountain! The viewpoints are many and so are the sights, eating opportunities and other cool stuff.\nIf you walked well, congrats, it\u0026rsquo;s now the (late) afternoon.\n(Late) Afternoon Lets go to Tsim Sha Tsui!\nSouth of this part of HK, you have another nice cluster: Nice buildings, the avenue of stars, the Bruce Lee statue and the harbor. There are plenty of museums as well, if that\u0026rsquo;s your thing. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty much bored out of them, so I visit sparingly.\nOnce night falls, be sure to see the drone show. If it\u0026rsquo;s not too late, or if you\u0026rsquo;re not tired yet, see Temple Street on the way back for a rewarding night market experience.\nDay 3: Hong Kong - Lantau Morning Let\u0026rsquo;s go get some greenery! To get to Lantau, the easiest way is to take the subway to Tung Chung. To get started for this day activity, you need to follow with a bus to Tian Tan Buddha. Those buses are near the man road, a bit north of the station, follow the tourists. This is the cheapest way to see the giant buddha and to start hiking Lantau Peak (934m according to Google), Lantau Peak is a good way to see the whole island.\nHence:\nI recommend walking around the Big Buddha, walk up the stairs, see the Po Lin Monastery then head out toward the hiking path; walking past the Wisdom path and its pillars, toward the hill and viewpoint over the island. Be prepared to walk quite a lot, with a terrain that is not that easy, I rolled my ankle on the way down, the next five days weren\u0026rsquo;t so fun. The picture for this section has been taken from the top.\nAfternoon From Ngong Ping Village (near the Buddha), there is a cable car station and a bus station. Early in the afternoon, there are buses every 30 minutes going to the Tai\u0026rsquo;O fishing village. That\u0026rsquo;s the destination.\nAccording to GMaps, bus number 21 is the only direct one, if you want to go down using the cable car, then you can use buses 1 and 11, it\u0026rsquo;s a 20 minutes drive.\nWalk around the market, spot the cats and eat delicious mochis! AThere is a promenade near the sea, a few nice shops (inexpensive compared to the rest of the country) and a marker. After that visit, it\u0026rsquo;ll probably be late, head back to Tung Chung by bus (Bus number 11) and zip back to mainland HK by subway (Orange line).\nFrom Tai\u0026rsquo;O, it\u0026rsquo;s easily two hours to get back to the center of Hong Kong\u0026hellip; Be prepared to be dead tired.\nDay 4: Hong Kong - Central Morning Now let\u0026rsquo;s explore the last important island of Hong Kong: Hong Kong Island (of course). The beautiful skyscrappers of the coastline, the monster building in Causeway Bay, the batteries and forts\u0026hellip; Just by going east along the coast, you have sights after sights. (I recommend taking the bus, it\u0026rsquo;s quite spread out, use and abuse it) If you like uncommon sights, you can go a bit further out and check out the Haw Par mansion or the Hong Kong movie archives (I haven\u0026rsquo;t been inside but the building is cool) Once I visited all of that I went to get some eggtarts from Bakehouse in Central (And to grab some lunch on the go)\nAfternoon If you too went to Bakehouse in Central, then you are near one of the main touristic area, the Central-Mid levels escalors and the main parts of Central. Enjoy the street art, the cool building and the escalator letting you go all the way to the base of Mount Victoria. And then\u0026hellip; It\u0026rsquo;s hiking time again.\nGo up the mountain for a good sunset/night view of the city! If you went up Lantau the previous day, without hurting youreslf like I did, then it should be fine. Even with one limping leg, I did it easily.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it for Hong Kong. If you have more time, then you can head to more museums, go shopping, see different viewpoints, see a horse race near Wan Chai, perhaps even go to Lamma Island\u0026hellip; If I were to be stranded one month in HK, I legit would never be bored!\nDay 5: Macau Morning Both Ferries and buses goes to Macau, I think I went with One Bus, but I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure, it\u0026rsquo;s been a while. There are two islands, drop your bags to your hotel in the right island!\nI started with Coloane, the southern island. Check out the casinos, the tram and, if by chance you have enough time, the Coloane village! I think it\u0026rsquo;s ok to visit until 3PM or something. Take your time. I didn\u0026rsquo;t visit Coloane Village, and I kinda regret, another traveler showed me pictures and it was hella cute. Instead I spent more time in the northern island and ended up rushing it a bit (Same as with Guangzhou)\nAfternoon Let\u0026rsquo;s go to the northern island. Start from A-Ma temple (at the tram\u0026rsquo;s terminus) and walk toward the center It\u0026rsquo;s as easy as that. On the way you have the Casa do Mandarim, a lot of portuguese churches, the Dom Pedro V theater, pastries\u0026hellip;\nThen, it\u0026rsquo;s time to see the Largo Do Senado, the Sao Paulo ruins and the Monte do Forte. That\u0026rsquo;s a lot!\nOnce night befell the skies, I headed east toward the casinos (such as the Lisboa, to get another night view. If you have more time, lucky you! Be sure to head to the Guia lighthouse while you have time (And see the San Lazaro district on the way)\nDon\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to add a day to spread it out, I walked more than 20 kilometers that day.\nDay 6: Guangzhou Morning Let\u0026rsquo;s go to Guangzhou.\nAnd take the train this time. Head north with a bus to Portas do Cerco (They also go round the island, ask around and see!), that\u0026rsquo;s the border. From there, after the crossing you get to a train station where you can use your remaining patacas before heading to Guangzhou.\nOnce in town, I recommend walk toward Yuexiu park starting form the Temple of Six Banyan Trees. From the temple go north to the Dr Sun Wat-Sen\u0026rsquo;s Memorial Hall then the Nanyue King Wen\u0026rsquo;s mausoleum.\nEat an early lunch before going to see the rest, otherwise you\u0026rsquo;re going to have a very late lunch.\nAfternoon Right after the mausoleum stands the big park hosting the famous ram statue and the Guangzhou museum an old building/viewpoint that is a cheap museum teaching about the city\u0026rsquo;s history and fights with pirates. Interesting and good for pictures! Before the dark replace the blue, use the metro to zap to the English district in Shamian. You can have a leisurely walk near colonial buildings, close to the river. In the late afternoon it\u0026rsquo;s busy in a good way. It does\u0026rsquo;t take too much time and allow you to see another side of the city.\nAfterwards, it should be around nightfall, head to the center to see the light show near the Guangzhou TV Tower, iirc it\u0026rsquo;s the Huacheng Plaza, the small island and then the new tower is across. An underground shuttle allow you to freely cross tehe river without worries, but there are a few bridges as well.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to use Didi to get to those places easily. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to find your way in the subway or to use the buses. I took more time than wanted to see the city because I walked too much and had too hard of a time finding my way. Hopefully, by now there are better transportation apps in english (AMAP was still in chinese only when I went\u0026hellip;)\nDay 7: Last day - Guangzhou/Shenzen Morning Use remaining time to finish the visit in Guangzou, I recommend to see the Shen Clan Ancestral Hall, but be sure to book in advance (online only) then head to the station and zip to Shenzhen. If you have time, the two parks neaer the Hall are both equally green and beautiful, it\u0026rsquo;s nice to take a break from the big city.\nAfternoon We are getting to the end of this article and i\u0026rsquo;m gtting Lazy. So refer to day 1 of Shenzhen and finish any unfinished business. Shopping, old town, the harbour, a hike\u0026hellip; There are many possibilities, but Shenzhen ain\u0026rsquo;t exactly a touristic city.\nDay X: With more days, ideas Too much time on your hands? Add a day for the casinos in Macau or spend one more night in Guangzhou to have more leisure!\nYou can also add a day in HK to hike, it\u0026rsquo;s a hiking paradise after all :)\nComments?

It sums up the tools and tricks that actually make a difference when moving around the country.\n(No shame: I used ChatGPT for quick formatting and some of the content)\nThere are no affiliations in this post, sadly. If any of the company mentioned here wishes to give me money, please do.\nEssential Apps \u0026amp; Tools AMAP It\u0026rsquo;s available in English, even on Android now (yay). Works much better than Google Maps in mainland China. Rather accurate for walking, buses, and metro. Stations are detailed down to exits and entrances. It\u0026rsquo;s wonky at times and there are untranslated parts. Google Translate /!\\ Download the Chinese language before arriving. The camera function is useful for menus and signs (It understandmy english better than my french!?). Conversation mode works decently for simple interactions, but I prefer to use the one in Alipay. VPNs Most of our sites (Google, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube…) are blocked. Install a VPN before entering China. LetsVPN and Astrill are common choices (I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get Windscribe or Google\u0026rsquo;s VPN to work). Some work better than others depending on the region, so it\u0026rsquo;s worth having a backup. If you have a foreign sim card with data in China, then there\u0026rsquo;s probably no need for a VPN. My French SIM Card with Free Mobile has 30 GB of data in China and let me use Whatsapp, Reddit and more without a VPN But the downside is that, with this one, I don\u0026rsquo;t have internet in France. Since I switched to a better provider, I had to say goodbye to those benefits\nTransportation Booking Trains Trains are the easiest way to move around (And are often cheap). Trip.com offers English booking, accepts foreign cards, and often has competitive prices. You\u0026rsquo;ll receive a QR code or pick-up code. A passport is required for every booking and at the station (They check\u0026hellip;). Using Didi Equivalent of Uber, but cheap. The app has an English interface and can be use through Alipay. Payment works with foreign cards or through Alipay. Payments Alipay QR code payments, anytime, anywhere. Non chinese citizen can link their bank card on it (needs a passport). If linking fails, apparently, there is a “Tour Pass” option you can top up. I never tried. WeChat Requires a stupid verification using chinese friend. You can get banned anytime for no reason. It\u0026rsquo;s a shitty app, I hate it. Payment with foreign cards is unreliable, but it\u0026rsquo;s still useful for messaging. I use Rednote for messaging now, it\u0026rsquo;s fine. Other Notes Cash: Be prepared to receive weird looks. I usually avoid paying by cash Trains vs flights: For distances under 1,000 km, trains are faster overall. Toilets: Widespread but basic; carry tissues and sanitizer. Etiquette: Avoid politics, queue firmly, stay polite and calm at all time, Thai style: Don\u0026rsquo;t lose face. Don\u0026rsquo;t speak about you-know-what. Don\u0026rsquo;t.

Really.\nOnce you have it, you can apply for the visa itself. Prices vary a bit depending on your nationality, but expect around 55–85 USD for the visa fee, plus an additional 14 USD entry tax at the border.\nAs of September 2025, there is still a requirement for a COVID test at the border. Not only it\u0026rsquo;s fake, but it\u0026rsquo;s also 35 USD for the privilege.\nIn total, I gave 100$ with a crisp bill.\nThe Agency There are plenty of agencies out there, but I can personally recommend the one and only Ruslan Hydyrov from IndieGuide. He was reliable, quick to answer emails, and knows the system inside out. *\nContact:\nPhone: +993 61 67 22 66 Mail: ruslanhydyrov@gmail.com If you get in touch, tell him you come thanks to Tim Paris (that\u0026rsquo;s me). He\u0026rsquo;ll know.\nThe Border At the moment (September 2025), the only open land border for tourists is near Dashoguz, the Shavat crossing from Uzbekistan.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re coming overland, you\u0026rsquo;ll likely cross from Khiva (Uzbekistan) into Turkmenistan.\nI took a Yandex shared with another traveler and found one in twenty minutes. It\u0026rsquo;s an hour drive, be prepared for a long wait and to have to give a bonus to your driver. I gave the equivalent of a very good meal as a bonus.\nFlights Flying in or out is possible, you have to book a flight through the official Turkmenistan Airlines website https://turkmenistanairlinestr.com/tr-TR\nFrom Ashgabat, there are direct flights to Istanbul, Milano, London and Frankfurt. Prices are low for Central Asia.\nTo go to Milano, I paid around 220€, a steal!\nSafety \u0026amp; Rules Turkmenistan has a reputation for being strict, but in reality it\u0026rsquo;s not as scary as you think.\nWalking at night in Ashgabat is totally fine. I did it without issues or hassle, despite me not having a guide. Safety is basically guaranteed: There are no crimes. Beards and long hair are fine, despite rumors of them being illegal. There is quite a lot of freedom, but avoid taking pictures of the military and other sensitive stuff. Internet is 99% blocked, you need a good VPN or to forget about using the internet. ATMs / Cost / Gifts There are no ATMs in the country, bring enough cash. Online transfers are painful, getting USD at the border or in Uzbekistan is hard, paying by visa is a no as well. BRING CASH.\nIt costs a lot. Tours are private, so the more you are, the cheaper it is. Expect to pay up to 200 USD a day.\nFor gifts: The dried apricots are to die for. I brought like half a kilo of them, I should have brought two.\nFinal Notes Turkmenistan is not an easy country to enter, but once inside, it\u0026rsquo;s a fascinating place.\nThe bureaucracy and fees are part of the package. If you prepare your documents, book through a good agency, and accept that things move at their own pace, you\u0026rsquo;ll be rewarded with one of the most unique trips you can have in Central Asia.\nBy the way here\u0026rsquo;s my itinerary: With the tour I did\nComments?

I started from Uzbekitan. The logical road used to be UZ-TM-IR nowadays, it\u0026rsquo;s only possible to go from UZ to TM. So I went to the Shavat border in Uzbekistan, taking a shared taxi from Khiva One hour later I was at the border, filled with Turkmen coming home with their shopping (TVs, PS4, computer stuff, air fryers\u0026hellip;).\nAfter a very long and stupid trip (you have to pay a bus to cross 200m through the No man\u0026rsquo;s land), I reached the Turkmen outpost, met my guide, Ruslan there. Here are his info:\nContact:\nPhone: +993 61 67 22 66 Mail: ruslanhydyrov@gmail.com If you get in touch, tell him you come thanks to Tim Paris (that\u0026rsquo;s me). He\u0026rsquo;ll know.\n(He\u0026rsquo;s aware I\u0026rsquo;m putting his contact info here, I asked for permission. I\u0026rsquo;m not gaining anything from this)\nAfter paying the necessary 100$ or something for the visa, entry and covid test, I was in!\nThe price is not the same for everyone, check with your guide and our nationality Also, carry a lot of cash with fresh USD notes, it\u0026rsquo;s mandatory\nSo, yeah, I got in the country, my guide met me at the border, we got a driver and went all the way to Konye Urgench to see the ruins. Felt a bit meh compared to Uzbekistan, much more ruined and spread out. It\u0026rsquo;s still nice for history buffs, especially when doing a guided tour, thing I didn\u0026rsquo;t do back in UZ.\nAfter Konye, we went to Darva- not. Back to the border town of Dashoguz. Yup, the road to Darvaza is not finished from Konye, so enjoy the long detour.\nFinally, after a bumpy road that was dreadful, I arrived at Darvaza, the gates of Hell!\nWe visited at night to see the beautiful flames and the stars.\nSee the pictures:\nNice isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\nDay 2 Darvaza This is a bit mixed with the previous day, sorry.\n(After a barbecue and some wildlife spotting, I slept in a Yurt near the crater until sunrise. The Darvaza crater during the day is quite a worrying sight, dying out and not much to boast. The gates to Hell are soon to be just a hole in the desert.\nAnyaway, we continued, seeing other craters on the way as well as the sand dunes, through the bumpy road. To where? Ashgabat of course.\nA city of white marble, of elegance, of rules (And of a ruler), dazzling in the desert. Ashgabat is only missing Aladdin and his flying carpet to be complete.\nI thoroughly enjoyed the visit, mostly by car, to the grand buildings and all the center of interests. Everything is so spread apart and most of the touristic attractions are actually outside of the lively city. It\u0026rsquo;s not a ghost town, just that most things you see on the internet are located near government buildings and near a soon-to-be forest.\nAt night, the city is also quite lively, I walked freely, met some people, spoke with soldiers, shook I don\u0026rsquo;t know how many hands, said hi to everyone and well\u0026hellip; just enjoyed the city by myself\nDay 3 Ashgabat Depending on you tour, you may have more time to have an in depth visit of Ashgabat. I think it\u0026rsquo;s worth it. The mosque is beautiful and the acoustic is incredible, it\u0026rsquo;s nice to see the busy train station, the roundabouts deserve their own tour, the indoor ferris wheel is stupid, the marriage center might be where you will find a bride, the station, a bribe\u0026hellip; The commercial centers are nice for shopping too, shop for the dried apricots, they are lovely (Best I had so far).\nOn your way out, admire the airport built like a bird and enjoy the cheap, fixed rate, flights to europe and more. I went Ashgabat-Milano as Paris is not deserved since covid, it was inexpensive for the quality, the only downside was the 100€ bus to go back home. One hundred for a bus, sheesh, what a bunch of loonies. Turkmenistan \u0026gt; Italy.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it folk. That was a short article, I know. I\u0026rsquo;m open to edit it if needed. Comments?

The sea breeze makes the promenade near the cliffs pleasant, and locals are out running, cycling, and fishing.\nA striking Soviet influence is visible in large avenues, dilapidated buildings, and dust everywhere. Without oil, Aktau would not have grown into the city it is today.\nThe morning is ideal for exploring the coast. Take a walk along the Skalnaya Tropa Promenade, a 1.5km scenic path along the cliffs, perfect for morning photos. Spot the Melovoy Lighthouse, built atop a residential building, and visit city landmarks like the Ship Statue and the monument to Ukrainian writer Taras Shevchenko.\nAktau serves as the gateway to the Mangystau region. Use the afternoon to book a tour to Mangystau. I personnaly used RedMaya Travel. If you have more time in the city, do visit the mosque, the memorial and spot the countless soviet murals on the walls.\nDay 2 Torysh \u0026amp; Sherkala Early departure with a small group leads out of Aktau. The back city reveals former gulag-style apartments and silent oil wells. Beyond the industrial edge, the steppe suddenly bursts into life.\nCamels, dromedaries, horses, and goats roam freely across the surprisingly green steppe. Summer rains have transformed the desert into fertile grazing land.\nThe first stop is Torysh – Valley of the Balls, filled with spherical rocks covered in marine fossils. Scientists remain puzzled by their origin. After a short break for lunch at a small roadside restaurant, the 4x4 drives further into the steppes.\nNext, climb Kolkala, the Blue Mountain, for its colorful strata and quartz formations. Nearby is Sherkala – Tiger Mountain, a large isolated rock with hidden tunnels once used as a fort and lookout. The day ends at Airakty Shomanai, where rocky “castles” surround the camp. Sunset and sunrise here are breathtaking, under the stars of the Tengri sky.\nDay 3 Bozjyra Plateau An early start involves packing tents and heading out for a long drive, passing desert villages and an oil town. The Ustyurt Plateau eventually opens into Bozjyra, a white, rocky plain with isolated cones, towers, and fang-like formations rising from the steppe.\nFew animals are seen beyond marmots and traces of goats. Rain and wind later force a move to a more sheltered roadside camp.\nThis one was my favourite day of the trip, Bozjyra is truly grand.\nDay 4 Tiramisu Canyon \u0026amp; Boktu The morning brings clear skies and scorching heat. Visit Tiramisu Canyon, with creamy white walls cut by brown striations and abundant fossils. The canyon is unique and photogenic.\nA detour to Boktu Mountain underlines the desert’s extreme heat. Optical illusions and mirages make the landscape seem otherworldly. Return to Aktau late in the day, exhausted and ready for showers.\nDay 5-6 Astana I took an early morning flight to Astana. The train would have been far too long (close to 24h!)\nThis city is modern, green, and beautifully planned, a stark contrast to Aktau.\nOver two days, walk the city, explore parks, squares, and monuments such as Baiterek, Hazrat Sultan Mosque, the Palace of Peace and Reconciliation, and Khan Shatyr, as well at the brand new mosque, at the edge of the city. It is the bigget mosque of Central Asia, but it strangely devoid of believers.\nConstruction is ongoing for metro lines and other infrastructure, hopefully it will open soon.\nThe capital is sunny and open, requiring sunscreen and patience for long pedestrian detours.\nDay 7 Aqmola \u0026amp; Alzhir Morning trip north from Astana to Aqmola.\nI used Yandex to find the needed bus and made my way to Aqmola, it took around one hour.\nVisit Alzhir, the gulag for wives and children of political prisoners under Stalin. The memorial is striking but leaves a sense of absence; exhibits are sparse compared to expectations. Walking the grounds, the scale and solitude of the site make the oppression feel palpable.\nReturn to Astana in the afternoon and prepare for a night train to Almaty. Those trains are comfortable and the trip will ends in no time, even though it lasts 17 hours.\nDay 8 Almaty City Arrival in Almatyn an historical city that did not preserve its history.\nVisit the Green Bazaar for local foods and snacks, Panfilov Park and Zenkov Cathedral, a colorful wooden building, close to an older traditional building (the musicial instrument museum, I believe). If you have time, take the cable car to Kok Tobe for city views. Museums like the Central State Museum offer historical context, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t been there, someone told me it was more or less the same than the one in Astana.\nThe city feels like Grenoble (The french chicago) without delinquency, with parks as calm oases amid Soviet urbanism.\nIT\u0026rsquo;s a really nice city to spend some time in and to base yourself for hikes.\nDay 9 Big Almaty Lake I went to hike to Big Almaty Lake with a friend, starting a bit late due to delays. he route follows a paved road, then water pipes requiring ropes. Military restrictions make the lake hard to access; it appears nearly empty, a contrast to iconic photos. So it was utterly disappointing.\nI inclded it here because in the end it\u0026rsquo;s my itinerary, but, it\u0026rsquo;s much better to skip it and add one more day from the trip to Charyn and Kolsai.\nContoversely, at sunset, the scenery is spectacular, at least ansd at last, a good thing.\nDay 10 Canyons and Lakes Book one of the numerous tour to get out of the city, especially one for Kolsai, Kaindy and the charyn canyon.\nTwo days is better than one, I did it in one, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t great. Everything was rushed and my group was super slow.\nThe first step is Lake Kolsai, abeautiful lake born from an earthquake, amidst a pine forest.\nNext is Lake Kaindy, where a flooded forest presents a surreal scene. Dead tree trunks rise vertically from the water, preserved after a historical landslide. Walking along the shore allows full appreciation of its haunting beauty.\nFinally, explore Charyn Canyon (Valley of Castles). Dramatic red cliffs, jagged formations, and visible wildlife make this a mesmerizing landscape.\nDay 11 Shymbulak Ski resort A ski resort?? Yu^p, it\u0026rsquo;s also a place to hike.\nHike above 3000 meters in the Tian Shan, near the Shymbulak ski resort.\nThe 1000-meter climb passes green alpine meadows to glaciers and snow. The hike is rocky, slippery, and slow, though a cable car from the base helps. Scenery is breathtaking, and locals are friendly, offering water and support along the route. Descent is tiring and even more slippery.\nI\u0026rsquo;d recommend the cable car on the way down, but be careful, it gets crowded. And it\u0026rsquo;s stupidly expensive too.\nDay 12 Toward Bishkek From the Almaty central bus station, take one of the numerous bus to Bishkek. They leave every two hours or something similar.\nThe bus ride covers 200 km in ~5 hours due to the border crossing.\nEvening is reserved for rest and recovery.\nFor travelers heading further to Karakol, buses run via Bishkek and around Lake Issyk Kul, a long but scenic route.\nKyrgyztan Day 13 Bishkek A simple day: Do a walk in the tiny city center, still under construction in parts.\nBishkek is flat, wide, and rather uninspiring. Tourists mostly come for the State History Museum, excellent for Soviet and nomadic history, and the new mosque, a Turkish-built replica inspired by Hagia Sophia.\nThe hostel I went in Apple Hostel Bishkek, in contrast to the city, was alive with travelers: young hikers, solo backpackers, and small groups exchanging stories and planning routes. The evening was spent chatting, meeting new people, and swapping travel tips.\nDay 14 Ala-Archa National Park Early morning departure to Ala-Archa National Park, just south of Bishkek.\nA half-day hike follows trails through pine forests and steep valleys. Streams and small waterfalls punctuate the path, while jagged peaks rise suddenly from the valley floor.\nAla-Archa is perfect for a mountain experience: accessible, yet offering a sense of remoteness. Trails are well-marked, but slippery rocks and mountain streams require attention. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to reach, there is a bus going straight to the trailhead, I found it on Yandex. Most hostels know the bus and where to take it.\nDay 15-17 Song-Kul Three days spent at Song-Kul, combining horse trekking and yurt stays.\nDeparture early morning from Bishkek, traversing valleys and mountain passes to reach Kyzart village. After lunch, each traveler receives a horse, with bags attached. The horses are independent and guide the ride across valleys, rivers, and ridges, experiencing drastic temperature drops from 30°C to 10°C.\nNights are spent in shared yurts, cold but charming. Over the following days, the trek alternates between steep mountain climbs and open plains for galloping. Horses move with grace through herds of horses and cattle, fully immersing travelers in steppe life.\nOn the final day, descend toward a lush village valley, Song-Kul fading behind. Afternoon transfer with six other travelers heads toward Karakol, saving time despite the long journey. Arrival is late evening.\nIt was my first multi days hike on a horse, it was truly something. I hate horses, but someone roped me into going, so I spent three days on a fart machine that did whatever he wanted. Great!\nDay 18 Karakol Karakol sits between Lake Issyk-Kul and the Tien Shan mountains, population around 100,000, swelling in summer with tourists.\nStroll the lively streets, cafés full of Russian and European visitors, and nearby small beaches on the lake. Local architecture is diverse: Russian-style “gingerbread” houses, a Tatar mosque, a Dungan mosque, and Dungan-Chinese restaurants. The bazaar is built from shipping containers.\nI went there straight after Song-Kul, using a shared taxi from Kyzart, it took around 7 hours due to road constructions.\nit\u0026rsquo;s the most beautiful city of Kyrgyztan, probably because it\u0026rsquo;s a russian/dungan city. I really aprpeciated the abundance of Dungan food.\nDay 19 Jeti-Ögüz Morning visit to the famous Sunday animal market, the largest in Central Asia. Livestock includes cows, horses, and sheep.\n(Do it when it\u0026rsquo;s a sunday, if it\u0026rsquo;s not, spend more time around Jeti Ogyuz, there are nice hikes in the area)\nMid-morning minibus takes the group to Jeti-Ögüz, with a shared taxi for the final stretch (~1.50€). The hike features red rock cliffs and alpine valleys. The trail to the viewpoint is less exciting, but scenery remains beautiful.\nAsk for Jeti Oguz Kogort (Resort), only a handful of buses go there, and not year round, seemingly not everyday either.\nReturn to Karakol involves hitchhiking due to missing minibus service. Arrival around 17:00.\nDay 20 Altyn Arashan Early departure via minibus from Karakol bazaar to trailhead. The first hour is muddy and under construction, with essential old water pipelines visible.\nBegin an 8-hour alpine hike with a companion. Dense pine forests, gray river valleys, and horses grazing accompany the path. Russian jeeps ferry non-hikers (~20€ each). Arrival at the yurt camp occurs in rain, with the valley more touristy than online photos suggest. The return hike can be done by hitching after the last minibus. A long, wet, and tiring day. But so worth it!! When you look up pictures of Kyrgyztan online, you\u0026rsquo;ll often see the Altyn Arashan valley. Now it\u0026rsquo;s crowded with camps, yurts, tourists and booming infrasture, but you can still find nice spots, especially going further.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re lazy, you can use a car to go up or down. They ask for 40€ or something similar.\nDay 21 Trip to Osh Transport day covers ~400 km to Osh, split into a 6-hour minibus and 12-hour overnight cargo bus through mountains. Summer heat and constant horn honking make it exhausting. Arrival is the next morning.\nImportant notes There is no real night bus to Osh. At least not in 2025. Go to the market and find a Cargo Bus\nIt\u0026rsquo;s at the \u0026ldquo;Kerben section\u0026rdquo; of the Dordoi market says people online. I haven\u0026rsquo;t found ths Kerben thing, but I went where cargo bus were loaded and found one leaving to Osh, I was allowed to seat behind the drivers. The whole night was seated with a family of four across a single row. Ouch. It was around 20€ for the privilege.\nDay 22 Osh \u0026amp; Pamir Highway Start Osh, the second city of Kyrgyzstan, is more Uzbek in character but surprisingly modern. Streets feature bubble tea, ice cream, pizza, and bars. Sacred mountain is unimpressive; the city is partially under reconstruction.\nDont waste time there it\u0026rsquo;s essentially just a starting point to the Pamir Highway or to Peak Lenin.\nPrepare for the Pamir Highway, a 7-day jeep journey through Gorno-Badakhshan toward Dushanbe. Afternoon briefing, then departure through arid mountains separating Fergana Valley from Alay Valley.\nDay 23-24 Peak Lenin / Pamir Highlights Journey climbs to 3,500 meters, passing villages and rivers with red mountains in view.\nStop at Lake Tulpir Kul, overnight in yurts. Peak Lenin viewpoints reveal snow-capped peaks (~7,000m) and glaciers.\nWith my group we spent one evening and a morning there, we did a small hike and enjoyed the red and green mountains as well as the multi colored lakes. Honestly, one of Kyrgyztan\u0026rsquo;s prettiest area.\nTadjikistan Day 25 Karakul Lake After a morning drive from Peak Lenin, we reached the border then went on to Karakul Lake, altitude ~3,600 meters.\nThe lake sits in a high-altitude desert, surrounded by jagged peaks and minimal vegetation. The water is clear blue and mirrors the mountains, creating a dramatic backdrop. Small local encampments are scattered along the shore. The wind can be strong, and temperatures drop rapidly in the late afternoon.\nEvening spent at the motel from THe Shining near the lake. It\u0026rsquo;s cold and barebone. Just like the landscape. Welcome to Tadjikistan.\nDay 26 Murghab Plateau A long day of driving, about 6.5 hours over rough roads.\nThe route passes through abandoned villages and vast desert scenery before reaching Murghab, the main hub. Murghab is a container town, poor but trading with China, with a small, somber market. Beyond Murghab, the road quality deteriorates further, dominated by trucks.\nWe stopped at a small, crystal-clear pond teeming with fish, and continued to Alichur, a village of ~800 inhabitants split between Kyrgyz and Pamiri communities. Locals invited us into an impromptu football game, and we tasted yak milk ice cream and enjoyed a yak steak dinner. The night sky was breathtakingly clear, filled with stars.\nDay 27 Langar \u0026amp; Wakhan Valley Departed Alichur toward Langar, near the Afghan border.\nMidway, we stopped at a high-altitude lake for photos, then hiked about three hours, reaching up to 4,800 meters. Marmots and wildflowers dotted the landscape, and the views across the Panj River into Afghanistan were spectacular. Descending to 3,000 meters, greenery and trees returned. Langar village is forested, with a guesthouse offering hot water and electricity—a rare luxury in this remote area. It\u0026rsquo;s a nice spot to rest and to explore the local culture.\nDay 28 Yamchun Fortress Morning drive to Khorog, with a stop at Yamchun Fortress, XII-century ruins perched above the valley. The fortress once guarded historic Afghan trade routes and offers panoramic views.\nWe visited Bibi Fatima hot springs, mingling with locals in the warm waters (naked lol).\nA light hike along the Panj River provided glimpses of both Afghan and Tajik villages. Arrival in Khorog, Gorno-Badakhshan’s capital (~38,000 inhabitants), was quiet and pleasant, though attractions are limited. The vibe there was bad. A member of anoither group got attacked by a guy with a rock, ended up going to the hospital. My group was followed by a weirdo named Hugo, trying his best to take the girls with him. He followed us everywhere and was always close by, preying.\nDay 29 Kalaikhum Six hours of driving along scenic but under-construction roads.\nThe Panj River provided the most striking views, with occasional stops in tiny villages. Kalaikhum itself is a minimal settlement, offering a chance to observe the Afghan border and wash clothes. The only thing worthwhile to do is resting and watching the afghans from afar. A bit boring.\nDay 30 Dushanbe The final leg of the Pamir Highway brought us to Dushanbe. The drivers pushed hard, stopping briefly at the Afghanistan viewpoint and Hulbuk Fortress (XII century, with a small museum). A short visit to Nurek Reservoir, with its clear waters and island, completed the leg. Arrival in Dushanbe at 16:00 was a relief; internet access and city comforts felt luxurious.\nIn the end, the best part of the trip was the people I have been with. Otherwise, the landscapes are a bit boring for the most part, the vibe is usually weird,\nthe company scammed me a few bucks and robbed me of two days, plus were unable to answer queries\u0026hellip; Its not a must do, just like Vietnam\u0026rsquo;s Ha Giang loop, it\u0026rsquo;s overblown and overrated;\nPerhaps it\u0026rsquo;s better on a motorbike, like many do. I guess it\u0026rsquo;s part of the appeal.\nDay 31 and 32 Panjakent Seven Lakes Morning transfer to Panjakent, near Uzbek border.\nExplore local bazaar, taste regional cuisine. Do a short excursions to Seven Lakes area. See the sunset over archaeological ruins of old Panjakent. It\u0026rsquo;s great if you transfer to Uzbekistan from there. I mostly followed other people here before heading to Khujand.\nIf you desire to skip it, use that time to get one more day in Dushanbe, and perhaps one more day for the Fergana valley or something.\nDay 33 Khujand – Historic City Shared taxi from Panjakent (~4 hours) to Khujand, the second-largest city in Tajikistan.\nKhujand is historic, with ancient ruins, a reconstructed fort, small museum, and mausoleum. City parks, the 24-meter Stalin statue, and modern interpretations of architecture provide points of interest.\nKhujand contrasts sharply with the remote Pamir villages and alpine landscapes, marking the end of the Tajikistan leg of the journey.\nThe city is worth it for its big museum\n(close to the boring Sugd historical museum, from the entrance, go left until you find the small gate heading inside) You\u0026rsquo;ll find a fake village, a building similar to the one in Uzbekistan, with hilarious paintings of the great leader inside as well as a hill overlooking th ecity, (site of cities built by Alexander and Cyrus the greats)\nUzbekistan Day 35 and 36 Tashkent Crossing from Khujand into Uzbekistan takes time beneath the blazing sun. The Tajik side involves long queues and a single building for passport control, while the Uzbek side proves faster but no less chaotic. The final leg to Tashkent feels like a scene from a road movie; crowded marshrutkas, animated drivers, and endless detours through suburban streets before the capital’s skyline finally appears.\nTashkent greets travelers with wide boulevards, fountains, and the scent of freshly cut grass from its manicured parks. Despite its size, the city feels calm and deliberate. The Chorsu Bazaar bursts with color; pyramids of spices, towers of melons, and endless chatter beneath the domed roof. Nearby, Soviet‑era mosaics blend with Islamic architecture, a visual reminder of Uzbekistan’s layered past.\nA ride through the Tashkent Metro, built in the 1970s, reveals marble halls and chandeliers worthy of a museum. Above ground, monumental brutalist buildings line vast avenues leading to the Amir Timur Square and the reconstructed Khast‑Imam complex, where ancient Qurans and blue‑tiled domes contrast the modern skyline. By night, the parks glow with fountains and soft music; a gentle end to the capital’s urban rhythm.\nDay 37 and 38 Samarkand The morning bus from Tashkent reaches Samarkand by early afternoon. Heat shimmers over the city’s turquoise domes, and the Gur‑i Amir Mausoleum rises like a mirage; its golden interior reflecting the ambition of Timur’s empire. A short walk away lies the legendary Registan, three madrassas framing the square with perfect symmetry. At sunset, the tiles flare gold and cobalt, and the evening light‑and‑sound show fills the plaza with theatrical grandeur.\nBeyond the monuments, Bibi Khanym Mosque stands half‑restored yet magnificent, while nearby markets hum with daily life. The following morning is devoted to Ulug Beg Observatory, a tribute to the region’s scientific legacy. The Afrosiyob ruins whisper of ancient Maracanda, their surviving frescoes hinting at forgotten empires. Finally, the Shah‑i Zinda necropolis dazzles with a corridor of blue domes and ornate façades; one of Central Asia’s most striking sights.\nAs daylight fades, travelers often continue toward Bukhara, a long road west through endless fields and distant mountains.\nDay 39 and 40 Bukhara Bukhara reveals itself as a labyrinth of sand‑colored walls, minarets, and quiet courtyards. The Po‑i Kalyan complex dominates the skyline, its great minaret once serving as both landmark and legend. Around it, mosques, madrassas, and caravanserais evoke centuries of Silk Road history. The air carries the scent of samsas baking in clay ovens, mingling with the sound of prayers and merchants calling from shaded stalls.\nMornings are perfect for exploring the Ark Fortress or wandering through narrow lanes where artisans still craft ceramics and jewelry. In the afternoon, the Lyabi Hauz square becomes the city’s living room; locals gather beneath mulberry trees, sipping tea by the reflecting pool. At dusk, Bukhara glows softly, its monuments turning amber under the desert sun, the hum of voices fading into calm.\nDay 41 and 42 Khiva The journey west continues by train through the steppe, leading to the walled oasis of Khiva. The Ichan Kala old town feels almost untouched, a compact maze of alleys, mud‑brick houses, and minarets glowing blue and sand‑gold under the heat. During the Melon Festival, the streets fill with music and parades, locals offering slices of sweet fruit to passing travelers.\nWithin the walls, the Kalta Minor Minaret stands unfinished but striking, wrapped in turquoise tiles. The Kuhna Ark, Tosh Hovli Palace, and countless madrassas preserve the flavor of a desert kingdom. By sunset, Khiva’s rooftops turn copper and rose, and the call to prayer echoes through the silent streets, a moment suspended in time.\nDay 43 \u0026amp; 44 Nukus \u0026amp; Karakalpakstan A long drive north leads to Nukus, gateway to the Karakalpakstan region and the once‑mighty Aral Sea. The Savitsky Museum surprises with avant‑garde Soviet art rescued from censorship, while outside the city the Mizdakhan Necropolis and nearby fortresses rise from the dust like mirages of an ancient world.\nFurther west, the landscape turns lunar a vast plain where ships once floated. The Ship Cemetery near Moynaq tells the story of ecological disaster: rusted hulls stranded in the sand, silent witnesses to a vanished sea. Travelers stand at the cliff edge overlooking the dry seabed, where waves no longer reach. The silence of Karakalpakstan is haunting, a fitting close to the long road across Central Asia.\nTurmenistan Tips on how to travel Turkemnistan The Agency There are plenty of agencies out there, but I can personally recommend the one and only Ruslan Hydyrov from IndieGuide. He was reliable, quick to answer emails, and knows the system inside out.\nContact:\nPhone: +993 61 67 22 66 Mail: ruslanhydyrov@gmail.com If you get in touch, tell him you come thanks to Tim Paris (that\u0026rsquo;s me). He\u0026rsquo;ll know.\nDay 45 Konye First thing first, find your way in the country. I started from Uzbekitan. The logical road used to be UZ-TM-IR nowadays, it\u0026rsquo;s only possible to go from UZ to TM. So I went to the Shavat border in Uzbekistan, taking a shared taxi from Khiva One hour later I was at the border, filled with Turkmen coming home with their shopping (TVs, PS4, computer stuff, air fryers\u0026hellip;).\nAfter a very long and stupid trip (you have to pay a bus to cross 200m through the No man\u0026rsquo;s land), I reached the Turkmen outpost, met my guide, Ruslan there.\nAfter paying the necessary 100$ or something for the visa, entry and covid test, I was in!\nThe price is not the same for everyone, check with your guide and our nationality Also, carry a lot of cash with fresh USD notes, it\u0026rsquo;s mandatory\nSo, yeah, I got in the country, my guide met me at the border, we got a driver and went all the way to Konye Urgench to see the ruins. Felt a bit meh compared to Uzbekistan, much more ruined and spread out. It\u0026rsquo;s still nice for history buffs, especially when doing a guided tour, thing I didn\u0026rsquo;t do back in UZ.\nAfter Konye, we went to Darva- not. Back to the border town of Dashoguz. Yup, the road to Darvaza is not finished from Konye, so enjoy the long detour.\nFinally, after a bumpy road that was dreadful, I arrived at Darvaza, the gates of Hell!\nWe visited at night to see the beautiful flames and the stars.\nSee the pictures:\nNice isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\nDay 46 Darvaza This is a bit mixed with the previous day, sorry.\n(After a barbecue and some wildlife spotting, I slept in a Yurt near the crater until sunrise. The Darvaza crater during the day is quite a worrying sight, dying out and not much to boast. The gates to Hell are soon to be just a hole in the desert.\nAnyaway, we continued, seeing other craters on the way as well as the sand dunes, through the bumpy road. To where? Ashgabat of course.\nA city of white marble, of elegance, of rules (And of a ruler), dazzling in the desert. Ashgabat is only missing Aladdin and his flying carpet to be complete.\nI thoroughly enjoyed the visit, mostly by car, to the grand buildings and all the center of interests. Everything is so spread apart and most of the touristic attractions are actually outside of the lively city. It\u0026rsquo;s not a ghost town, just that most things you see on the internet are located near government buildings and near a soon-to-be forest.\nAt night, the city is also quite lively, I walked freely, met some people, spoke with soldiers, shook I don\u0026rsquo;t know how many hands, said hi to everyone and well\u0026hellip; just enjoyed the city by myself\nDay 47 Ashgabat Depending on you tour, you may have more time to have an in depth visit of Ashgabat. I think it\u0026rsquo;s worth it. The mosque is beautiful and the acoustic is incredible, it\u0026rsquo;s nice to see the busy train station, the roundabouts deserve their own tour, the indoor ferris wheel is stupid, the marriage center might be where you will find a bride, the station, a bribe\u0026hellip; The commercial centers are nice for shopping too, shop for the dried apricots, they are lovely (Best I had so far).\nOn your way out, admire the airport built like a bird and enjoy the cheap, fixed rate, flights to europe and more. I went Ashgabat-Milano as Paris is not deserved since covid, it was inexpensive for the quality, the only downside was the 100€ bus to go back home. One hundred for a bus, sheesh, what a bunch of loonies. Turkmenistan \u0026gt; Italy.\nComments?

It was the cheapest flight to Kazakhstan I could find, by the way.\nHow to Visit Mangystau Independent travel is technically possible, but unless you speak Russian or Kazakh, can drive long hours on bad tracks, and are ready to camp without support, it\u0026rsquo;s far easier to go with a local tour.\nI joined a small group tour with a local tour operator I found online prior to arrival. We were six travelers split into two cars, with a driver each and the addition of a guide. Those three were family, accustomed to work together and had all the necessary camping and cooking guide.\nThe driving time were so looooong and the road so confusing, I defo can\u0026rsquo;t recommend going on your own. And don\u0026rsquo;t even think about public transportation, there are barely any cities, and when there\u0026rsquo;s one (or a village) you are still up to 100km away from something meaningful. Due to this, you cannot do it on a true budget as well, you need money $$! (I used RedMaya Travel btw, so I recommend them!)\nFood \u0026amp; Water Meals were a mix of canteens and camp cooking.\nCanteens: Simple Kazakh cuisine in big portions. Not too bad imho. Camp meals: Far better than I expected!, It was filling and varied (as camp-cooking goes), Extras: Bring snacks along the way, sharing is caring. They even managed to accommodate food allergies, which is nice!\nSights \u0026amp; Walking The main reason you come here: the landscapes.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t spoil every stop, but highlights include Bozjyra Canyon, Torysh (Valley of 𝓑𝓪𝓵𝓵𝓼), underground mosques, and surreal plateaus that stretch to the horizon.\nThree days is enough to see the main sites at a good pace, four days would be overkill, two would be boring. Hence I think three is just right.\nI walked between 7 and 14 km each day, though you could walk less, I just prefer exploring on foot once on-site and so did my group (be careful of the heat, it\u0026rsquo;s painfully hot in July).\nIn the end, the rhythm works: long drives, stops to hike and look around, camping under a sky full of stars.\nGuiding \u0026amp; Driving Our guide was knowledgeable, talkative, and very Kazakh in spirit. He added depth to the journey beyond the sights (Thanks ChatGPT for that nice sentence).\nThe two drivers handled rough roads and sand tracks without issue. Communication was slower with them, as their English was limited, but everything ran smoothly.\nCost Mangystau isn\u0026rsquo;t a budget trip.\nTours are on the expensive side, especially compared to other parts of Kazakhstan.\nThat said, you\u0026rsquo;re paying for two drivers, one guide, proper 4x4 vehicles, fuel, camping gear (tents are usually single-use, one per person), and full logistical support.\nFor three full days, the price made sense, especially since there isn\u0026rsquo;t that much demand yet.\nPractical Notes Best time to go: Spring and autumn. Summers can be brutally hot, winters are cold and windy. Packing: Layers, good shoes for walking on rocks and sand, sunscreen, a hat. Connectivity: Mobile coverage is almost non-existent in the desert. Toilets: Wild camping = wild toilets. Don\u0026rsquo;t expect facilities. Sleep: Be prepared to camp. It\u0026rsquo;ll be windy. Where to Next? Mangystau fits into a wider trip across Kazakhstan or Central Asia. From Aktau, you can continue in several directions:\nAstana: Direct flights from Aktau, usually the fastest way (That\u0026rsquo;s what I did!) Almaty: Flights exist, but if you prefer trains, be ready for a very long journey, ie: over 2,500 km, and 24h, or so I\u0026rsquo;ve heard. Uzbekistan: There are trains south from Aktau toward Beyneu, where you can connect onwards to Nukus (in Karakalpakstan,). This is a good option if you want to see the ship graveyard and head towards the silk road. Istanbul: Flights are common, I came through Istanbul, Kebabistan. Tblissi: A lot of flights as well, it might be a decent option. Comments?

Trains may exist as well, but that really depends on your starting city, from Yunnan, you have to flight, despite the geographic proximity (1500 km lol).\nI was sick when I arrived, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t visit the Norbulingka palace as intended, if you\u0026rsquo;re healthy, do me a favor and visit it and tell in the comments how it was! Apparently it can be visited independently.\nDay 2 Drepung Sera Drepung and Sera monasteries.\nThe spiritual heart of Lhasa and, by extension, of Tibet. Did I draw you in? Good.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s an interesting day, seeing the monks debating, seeing the high altitude life, having a bird\u0026rsquo;s view on Lhasa, its parks, its life, its vibrancy\u0026hellip; I was too sick to remember plainly, but that filled a day quickly!\nIf you have time, do visit the Tibetan culture museum.\nIt goes in depth on the topic of Tibet\u0026rsquo;s liberation from the evil powers: England, Russia and \u0026ldquo;more\u0026rdquo;. Thanks to China and its peaceful army, they freed the tibetan slaves from the evil alliance of conspirators; Wakanda, Tuvalu and Greenland\u0026hellip;\nDay 3 Potala palace Fuuuuuuu-sion! Sorry, those were the potara earrings.\nSo, the potala palace is the masterpiece of Lhasa and Tibet. I would say hat Tibet is worth visiting just for the palace, it\u0026rsquo;s truly a world wonder.\nThe whole morning was dedicated to the Potala palace. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen every angle, went to the top (I fully recovered from my illness, it was due to bad food.) and enjoyed it so much!\nAfter the Potala palace, I went right under, to Barkhor Street, to see the monastery, the last one of the big 3: Jokhang! There are also a few museum around the area, and a hidden KFC, posing as a traditional building. Or perhaps it was there since the ancient times, who knows.\nKFC in Gyantse\nDay 4 Gyantse You got a guide? Yes? You can leave the city. Let\u0026rsquo;s make our way to the EBC!\nBut first, we need to stop at every possible viewpoint, because you made it to the Himalaya, bitch!\nThe lake Yamdrok is pretty, with its azure color, but is a bit touristy. Gyantse is a quick stop, there is one fortification I saw from after. It\u0026rsquo;s still the title of the section, but that was boring. The Korola glacier was completely filled with trash. I cleaned as much as I could under the laugher of the chinese, throwing gas bottles and plastic everywhere they went knowing I would pick it up. Some guys helped me, french obviously, then we were met by younger chinese people (\u0026lt; 30) that gave more than a hand. I think that, together, we picked up half a dozen kilo. Yay. Yup, that\u0026rsquo;s all I remember from the melted glacier, take that how you want.\nAfter that, we stopped in Shigatse for the night. Ate some delicious food in a restaurant in the old city, that was great.\nDay 5 EBC After a quick visit of the little palace in Shigatse, very interesting while similar to those of Lhasa, we took the long winding road to the Everest Base Camp. Probably seven hours on a mountain road. Thanks god it was a good one, yet, it was still a drive I\u0026rsquo;ll remember. Folks, don\u0026rsquo;t lose you hearing, ever since I lost my sence of balance and I get sick in transports.\nEverest Base Camp is big, very big. There are a lot of tents with ten times as many dancing chinese. They party as they made it to the world\u0026rsquo;s roof, in front of the incredible Everest. I managed to see the peak, some were there for a week, only to catch that specific glimpse. It lasted like 20 minutes during the day, another 20 at night. Look at the cool pictures.\nDay 6 Gyirong Before leaving EBC, we visited one of the world\u0026rsquo;s highest monastery Rongbuk. It\u0026rsquo;s not interesting architecturally, but there\u0026rsquo;s a bit of history (destroyed by Mao Zedong forces, rebuilt by Deng Xiaoping\u0026rsquo;s policies. Life\u0026rsquo;s harsh up there)\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t go to Kathmandu, you go back to Lhasa. I went on to Nepal, with a very small group.\nWe made a stop for lunch in a town in the middle of nowhere, where locals seldom see any foreigners. It was weird to have everyone gawking at our very small group. For some, it was the first time they saw a man with long hair, weird isn\u0026rsquo;t it? It was so remote, it was like catching a glimpse into the \u0026ldquo;real tibet\u0026rdquo;.\nWe went past the barley fields, crossed the desert and the dunes, crossed a mountain and\u0026hellip; met a lush jungle. I shit you not, desert to jungle took like, 10 minutes? By driving of course. It\u0026rsquo;s just separated by a single range of mountain. The Himalayas are wild man. Gyirong is another case of a town where locals barely see any westerners. Foreigners, yes, nepali are common, but not a group made of: a German, two french of different ethnicities, a latina and an ashkenazi we met along the way.\nDay 7 Road to Kathmandu Last day!\nAnd a fun one, in a way. The border on the chinese side is super modern, right on time, with a military parade and everything. The nepali side is\u0026hellip; very different. A small mud house with only one entrance, a guy sitting on a stool, in front of a barrel writting things by hand, the \u0026ldquo;roads\u0026rdquo; which are actually just muddy paths. Going from one side to the other makes you go back 30 or 40 years back in time; I\u0026rsquo;m not even joking.\nAnd, important info, if you think this part of the trip is just one long lonely muddy road, well\u0026hellip; That\u0026rsquo;s wrong! You cross a beautiful national park and our driver made many stops along the way, for some excellent viewpoints. If you\u0026rsquo;re lucky, perhaps you may gaze on a very rare Red Panda?\nComments?

It\u0026rsquo;s easy to know why\nBetween the culture, the fabuous food and the sights, it\u0026rsquo;s the perfect entry point to China It\u0026rsquo;s easy to navigate and well connected The weather is good all year round long This is an excerpt from a longer article\nNote: This article detailing logistic can be a nice read as well\nTips on how to travel China Important: This trip is for 7/8 days, ending in Diqing/Shangri-La I recommend spending upward of 10 days in Yunnan, don\u0026rsquo;t rush it like I did\nIf you have 7 days: Remove the tiger leaping gorge If you go back from Kunming - You can skip Shangri-la to ease the logistic If you have 10 days: Add a day to the Tiger leaping Gorge and one in Kunming 14 days? Add 2 days in Kunming, 1 in Shaxi, 1 or 2 for Tiger Leaping Gorge and one in Diqing/Shangri-La \u0026ndash; You\u0026rsquo;ll thank me later. Day 1: Kunming ^Yuan Tong\nI Departed from Paris (CDG) to arrive in Kunming (the next day, lol).\nFlights through Asia are often cheaper via Istanbul, Doha, or Bangkok.\nI went through Bangkok. Hence the long time.\nOnce I arrived, I took a walk to the green Park and the Yuan Tong temple, both near each other.\nKunming is big, very big. I stayed two days, but I recommend three or four to better acclimatize to the country\nSince I was there only two days, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t see the Dongchuan Red Land\nDongchuan Red Land on another blog It\u0026rsquo;s a long day trip, doable before and after summer. It\u0026rsquo;s great for photographers, but is an expensive trip\nIf I had one more day, I could also have visited Longmen, Lake Dian and Yunnan Ethnic village (They are all close together)\nDay 2: Stone Forest (Shilin) Morning bus to Shilin, the Stone Forest, about 90 km southeast of Kunming.\nGetting from Kunming to the Stone Forest (Shilin) The Stone Forest (Shílín / 石林) lies about 90 km southeast of Kunming, and the easiest way to reach it is by long-distance bus from Kunming East Bus Station (昆明东部客运站). Take Line 3 to East Bus Station, buy a ticket and travel for almost two hours The ride costs about 35–45 RMB Entrance fee fro Shilin: around 130–175 RMB, depending on season.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a bit pricey, and very touristy in the main areas, but as soon as you stray from the main path you can see many rock formations AND be alone. But the main part is the prettiest one.\nI met some people on the way, we braced the rain, took cool pictures and walked the whole geopark (or it felt like that, 30k steps) Technically, it can be visited in one long morning, I decided to spend as much time as possible.\nIf you have time in the evening, I recommend visiting one of Kunming old city, those are good places to get food and see some sights! I went around Wuhua, but Guandu is an option.\nDay 3: Dali Salvador??? Not this dalí, actually, but it\u0026rsquo;s even better.\nAlright, take a morning train to Dali (8:30 departure, arrival around noon), followed by a bus. I just asked around and got dropped near my hotel in Old Town. Because, yes, the train station is n the new Deli, to the south of Lake Erhai. The old town is south west.\nThey are well connected, so it\u0026rsquo;s easy to visit.\nI spent the whole afternoon exploring Dali Ancient Town and the Three Pagodas.\nThe place is charming and walkable, surrounded by mountains and Lake Erhai to the east.\nIt was pretty easy to navigate, the old town is quite small actually.\nMany hikes are available around, but beware of the weather\nA long afternoon of nonstop walking was enough to see 75% of Old Dali. And I had to rush a bit.\nDay 4: Lake Erhai \u0026amp; Xizhou Near the lake (around Caicun Wharf) there are many bikes to rent. I borrowed one for a small amount of money (A shitty one ^^\u0026rsquo;) and did a loop around Lake Erhai, heading toward Xizhou Village.\nFlat, scenic, and easy to navigate, though the ride is long, very long. My bike wasn\u0026rsquo;t the best either, but its just pathetic excuses.\nThe ride is a mere 20 km one way, Or two hours and a halfish when running. But there are many nice spots and stops along the way, I spent quite a lot of this riding time to gaze at the architecture.\nBe careful of the sun, the altitude is high and despite the cloudiness and the rain, I got sunburnt.\n^Pretty little house\nI arrived in Xizhou around noon, just in time to eat some street food in the old town. My bike was parked outside the city, the best I could, no way around it.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s one of the nicest day trips in Yunnan, with good weather, it\u0026rsquo;s a joy. And, my, the architecture, once again, it\u0026rsquo;s so pretty. The flowers, the house, the rice fields, the weddings\u0026hellip; Such a beautiful little trip.\nYes, I loved it.\nI spent my evening in Dali old town again. It\u0026rsquo;s lovely and the restaurants are many.\nDay 5: Lijiang Bus from Dali Old Town to Lijiang (8:30 departure, arrival around 11:30).\nThere are many buses you can catch from old town, as many do this trip. Train are also running, but that means going back to new town, so depending on your accomodation or your love of Didi (Nice try), it\u0026rsquo;s not ideal.\nIf you have one more day, you can stop in Shaxizhen, but it requires a change of bus in Jianchuan. It\u0026rsquo;s doable as a long day trip, but with your luggage and everything, it\u0026rsquo;s not the best. I heard no feedback about Shaxi.\nAnyway, spend the afternoon in Lijiang Old Town: crowded but beautiful. The must is a walk to Black Dragon Pool and to the less crowded Shuhe Village. I did walk to Shuhe, the bus system is a bit hard for foreigners, but locals are helpful. So I came back by bus.\nNote: Lijiang is actually really big. Even though it doesn\u0026rsquo;t look like it. Once again, if buses are too hard, Didi is your friend.\nI stayed above the old town so I could have a bird eye view of Lijiang.\n^Lijiang at night\nDay 6: Lijiang Jade Dragon Snow Mountain Day trip to Blue Moon Valley and the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain area.\nAltitude hits 4500m near the top, so bring warm clothes even in summer.\nThere are organized shuttles that make it easy to visit without hiking too hard.\nThe turquoise water and mountain views are stunning when the weather clears and you can go yak spotting. Or Jacks, as they call it with their wrong french translation.\nFor me the highlight was definitely the Blue moon valley and the lakes. They have stunning colors and a nice shimmer, the signs around are hilarious if you can read french (Yes they are translated in French for some reason), like one said forbidden to assholes instead of Smoking is prohibited. And one, in english, said something like ecleptic car paint instead of electrical car. Yup.\nIf you have time and can understand chinese, you can checkout the Theatre: Impression Lijiang. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen it from afar, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t understand anything.\n^Looks like Pamukkale\nDay 7: Lijiang Tiger Leaping Gorge I couldn\u0026rsquo;t do it due to time constraints (Visa was only 15 days when I went - I was heading to tibet afterward) So I missed the Leaping Tiger Gorge, only seeing it from afar (Very far~).\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s definitely a good spot to visit.\nTransportation runs regularly between Lijiang, the gorge and Shangri-La. But be careful, the logistic to do it this way might be hard\nDay 8: Shangri-La Bus north to Shangri-La (Also known Zhongdian), around 4 to 5 hours.\nAltitude here is 3200m, if you\u0026rsquo;re weak to altitude you may feel it.\nVisit the Old Town and the huge Ganden Sumtseling Monastery, but if you look closely with the last one, you\u0026rsquo;ll see there\u0026rsquo;s no gold, it\u0026rsquo;s yellow paint.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s not much to do, but it fills a full day. There are hikes around, I met friends that went for two days, from the pictures I\u0026rsquo;ve been sent, it\u0026rsquo;s visually very close to Tibet proper. So if you want to extend your trip, do take one more day to see around, the best way to get info on hikes is to ask the hostel directly, they had many documents on nearby hikes, but most need transportation to and from. (Didi is your friend)\nShangri-La marks the end of the road for most Yunnan routes; from here, people often head back to Lijiang or continue toward Sichuan. I went to Lhasa by flight, it was direct and relatively cheap. It\u0026rsquo;s not doable\nPractical Notes Transport: trains between Kunming–Dali and buses for the rest. Booking: Trip.com works fine; hostels can help too. Budget: around 30–40 € per day once you\u0026rsquo;re there. SIM \u0026amp; Apps: Amap (now in English) + Alipay are essential. Best season: March to October apparently, though summer rains can hit. One week was way too short, man, now that the visa free policy is for 30 days (Check if it applies to you), it\u0026rsquo;s much better I would have rather done 12 days or something, I loved it so much On the plus side, I can return there and enjoy it again!\nComments?

Walk in, ask around, you\u0026rsquo;ll find a deal. Budget: You can realistically get three days for under 400 €. That usually includes park fees, guide, car, fuel, accommodation (camping or budget lodges), and food. Group tours: Cheaper if you join others instead of booking private. Groups are usually 4–6 people per car. Note: I went in 2023, prices must have hiked up. Expect 450 or even 500€, inflation is a bitch.\nWhere to Book Local agencies are the key.\nFor example, in Arusha (Tanzania), there\u0026rsquo;s an agency literally next to the Arusha Backpackers Hostel. I walked in and had a tour booked within hours.\nOtherwise, it\u0026rsquo;s Africa, everyone knows a guy. People will even approach you, just wait and pick the best option, lol.\nPractical Tips SIM card first: As soon as you land, get a local SIM. Makes it easier to coordinate with agencies, guides, and fellow travelers. And for safety. You might need it. Believe me. What to bring: Warm clothes for nights, sunglasses, sunscreen, power bank, and a decent camera if you care about photos. Food \u0026amp; water: Usually included, but it\u0026rsquo;s smart to have extra snacks. Is it Worth It? Absolutely. Even on a budget trip, you still see the same lions, elephants, giraffes, and endless savannahs as the people who paid ten times more.\nThe only difference: they\u0026rsquo;re sipping wine in a lodge at night, and you\u0026rsquo;re in a tent.\nFor me, that trade-off is more than fine.\nHowever, truth be told, sometimes it feels a bit \u0026ldquo;on rail\u0026rdquo;. It was like going to the Thoiry Zoo near Paris, seeing one animal after the other in a way that was crafter by the guide. I was tired on the third day, it felt a bit too similar. I\u0026rsquo;m not that crazy about wildlife, so it checks out.\nComments?

It sums up the tools and tricks that are often crucial, especially when moving between different countries and cultures. Always check country-specific advice!\n(No shame: I used a helpful AI Assistant (Gemini) for quick formatting and to synthesize common advice)\n🌍 Essential Apps \u0026amp; Tools Google Maps / HERE Maps / Maps.me Google Maps is generally reliable in large cities and for major routes. Maps.me and Organic Maps are often better for offline use and in remote/safari areas. Rather accurate for major landmarks, but off-road tracks can be misleading. /!\\ Download offline maps for every region you plan to visit before you lose connectivity. WhatsApp It\u0026rsquo;s the primary communication tool for most people and businesses. You\u0026rsquo;ll use it to message tour guides, lodges, taxi drivers, and new friends. Google Translate /!\\ Download language packs (e.g., Swahili, Afrikaans, French, Portuguese\u0026hellip;) for offline use. The camera function is useful for menus and signs, but not always perfect for complex dialects. (Like in Ethiopia) Currency Converter (e.g., XE Currency) Essential with over 50 currencies and fluctuating exchange rates. Great for quick conversion when bargaining in markets to ensure a fair price. VPNs are generally, not needed, as most major international sites are accessible. A security-focused VPN is still useful for protecting your data on potentially unsecured public Wi-Fi, which happens a lot.\n🚗 Transportation Booking Flights \u0026amp; Overland Domestic Flights: Recommended for covering the continent\u0026rsquo;s vast distances quickly (e.g., between South Africa and Kenya). Overland Tours/4x4 Rental: The most common way for safaris and exploring remote parks. Using a local travel agent or the airline/bus company website directly is often best. Ride-Hailing Apps (Uber, Bolt, Indriver) Uber and Bolt are common, while Indriver is popular in parts of West and North Africa. Generally considered a safer, more transparent option than hailing a street taxi. Payment is easiest by linking a foreign card to the app. Minibuses \u0026amp; Shared Taxis Also known as Matatus (Kenya), Tro-tros (Ghana), or Daladalas (Tanzania). Extremely cheap and authentic but often crowded, less comfortable, and do not follow a strict timetable (they leave when full). 💰 Payments Mobile Money (M-Pesa, Airtel Money) Mobile Money is King in East Africa (Kenya, Tanzania) and increasingly common elsewhere. It\u0026rsquo;s a phone number-based payment system used for nearly everything, from street vendors to park entry fees. Non-residents can usually register for a Mobile Money account with a local SIM card and passport. Cash (USD/Local Currency) Cash is Essential and widely used. Many local markets, small shops, and rural areas are cash-only. US Dollars (USD): Widely accepted (and often required) for visas, major tourist expenses, and tips. Only bring new, clean, post-2006 bills—old or damaged notes are often rejected. Credit/Debit Cards: Widely accepted in high-end hotels, major supermarkets, and tourist centers in major cities. Expect surcharges of 3-10% in some places. Visa and MasterCard are most common. ATMs: Available in cities and towns. Use bank ATMs during the day and be discreet.\nInform your home bank of your travel dates to avoid card freezing.\nOther Notes SIM Card: Buying a local SIM card is cheap and vital for navigation, ride-hailing, and Mobile Money. Trains vs flights: For distances under 1,000 km, often a high-quality intercity bus is the most reliable balance between speed and cost, as train networks are limited. Toilets: Varies greatly; carry tissues and hand sanitizer. Etiquette \u0026amp; Safety: Publicly displaying wealth (expensive phones, jewelry) is discouraged in cities. Always ask before taking a picture of a person. Be patient, polite, and embrace the concept of \u0026ldquo;Africa Time\u0026rdquo; (things move slowly). Politics/Military: Avoid sensitive topics, queue firmly, and never take pictures of government, police, or military installations. Comments?

It\u0026rsquo;s dating from July 2023 and was written in October 2025\nBefore diving in, a few considerations:\nThe country isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly safe The cops are corrupt, Addis is a robber haven Solo travel is rarely done, for a reason Every part of the country has a different weather Scams are frequent -\u0026gt; More about that later English is widely spoken Ethiopia is super expensive and expansive A civil war broke out around 2020, the country is still shaken Note: This article detailing logistic can be a nice read as well\nTips on how to travel Africa Itinerary done quick 🇪🇹 Ethiopia Day Destination Notes Day 1 Addis Ababa Arrival Day 2 Gondar Bus to Gondar Day 3-4 Simien Mountains Trek to Simien Day 5 Gondar Town \u0026amp; castle Day 6 Bahir Dar Visit the town Day 7 Bahir Dar Blue Nile Falls \u0026amp; Lake Tana Day 8 Lalibela Bus to Lalibela Day 9 Lalibela Rock hewn churches Day 10 Lalibela Monasteries Day 11 Lalibela to Harar Flight east Day 12 Harar Old city \u0026amp; hyenas Day 13 Addis Ababa Return \u0026amp; rest Day 14 Arba Minch Prepare the Omo valley Day 15-17 Omo Valley Omo Valley Tribes Day 18 Konso to Moyale Border to Kenya As you can see, I didn\u0026rsquo;t include the extreme north and the Dalol depression. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t due to the resuming fights Both Axum and Dalol were off limits for most (Some people managed to do it, I don\u0026rsquo;t know how, but congrats to them ^(=_=)^)\nNote: Konso is apparently named Karat now Taking flights from Lalibela to Harar is a fast way to do the trip, not an ecological one Day 1 Addis Ababa ^Ethiopian food\nWelcome to Addis, a city of contrasts, coffee and chaos, prayers and pickpockets.\nScammers will follow you around pretending to “practice English”, then demand tips.\nPhotos of poverty (Like slums and beggars), cultural centers, or government buildings are strictly forbidden.\nPolice might try to beat you up for it. Don\u0026rsquo;t trust the police.\nNever try to flirt with policewomen. They\u0026rsquo;re not up for it.\nSpend your day exploring Meskel Square, the Ethnological Museum, and the National Museum of Ethiopia (where Lucy rests).\nI also really liked, Saint George\u0026rsquo;s church and its turtles as well as the Holy trinity Cathedral. In the late afternoon, I went up Mount Entoto*, it\u0026rsquo;s an easy hike up.\nAt night, Addis\u0026rsquo; food scene shines, try Shiro, Injera, and local honey wine (if you\u0026rsquo;re an alcohoolic).\nDay 2 Gondar From Addis, I took a long and early bus (11h) to Gondar, the “Camelot of Africa.”\nThere were afew nice stops, but essentialy, it was a wasted day.\nOn my first evening in Gonder, I walked around my accomodation and spoke with other travelers. If you have more time, try to see the Fasilides Bath, a bit out of the center, or even the Debre Birhan Selassie Church.\n(Wikivoyage) https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Gondar This article is outdated, yet still useful.\nDay 3 and 4 Simien Mountains ^Gelada Baboons\nWith a very small group I left Gondar early, heading into the Simiens\nYou need both a guide and an armed ranger to enter the park.\nWe waited nearly two hours at the ranger station before being allowed in (there was no one, lol).\nIn the meantime, we enjoyed coffee and watched the broken UN cars going through.\nIt was a nice visit, even though it was super cloudy. The mountains are beautiful, the baboons ever present and the air felt nice. Many locals around, showing you their handicrafts, the guide and the ranger telling little stories\u0026hellip;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a good trip, really.\nBy the time we set camp, the rain was coming down hard.\nAnd on the same night, amidst the storm, a mexican tourist heard the gunshots By paying attention, yup, not just rain. Trust the mexican on that.\nThe second day was pretty much the same as the previous day, with a few other viewpoints, especially cliffs and waterfalls. We saw more Gelada baboons and a lot of birds.\nDay 5 Gondar ^African Camelot\nStone castles rise from green hills; Fasil Ghebbi is a surreal sight, it looks a bit like medieval Europe.\nAfter a morning around the castles (You HAVE to hire a guide), I spent the afternoon exploring the city and its sights.\nI also met a nice chinese man named James with whom I travelled manyfolds during the same trip\nHonestly, Gondar is not a very long visit. Some parts of the centers are nice and riding the many rickshaws is nice.\nCareful for the scams, you agree on a price, then say it\u0026rsquo;s 100 times that amount. 100€ for 5 minutes is a bit much.\nDay 6 Bahir Dar The drive to Bahir Dar is short (3 hours), resting on the edge of Lake Tana, it\u0026rsquo;s a wealthy town.\nOn my day there, I went to visit the Martyr\u0026rsquo;s Memorial, ate at Bet Diplomat, went around the markets and walked around the lake, there\u0026rsquo;s a nice promenade.\nDay 7 Blue Nile Falls / Lake Tana monasteries ^Blue Niles falls\nAn early bus ride and a muddy hike to the Blue Nile Falls.\nEven muddy as hell in July, it\u0026rsquo;s still beautiful.\nAt the entrance, they will force a guide upon you, saying you will get lost otherwise: It\u0026rsquo;s a lie. The guide I had kept trying to offer me prostitutes and kept saying he let tourists fucked this or that girl (Sometimes, they were kids and teens. Absolutely disgusting.)\nIn the afternoon, I went to see Lake Tana and its monasteries.\nScammers are rampant here, especially for the boat tours. They\u0026rsquo;ll approach you, speaking of a “student boat association”, it\u0026rsquo;s fake.\nStick to official operators or boats arranged by your hotel/hostel.\nDay 8 Road to Lalibela The bus journey to Lalibela takes a full day, winding through dusty Gashena.\nIt doable in one day, you just have to start early. As soon as I reached Gashena, the bus driver pointed at shared taxis and I immediately got into one going north. It was easier than I thought.\nOtherwise, there is nothing to see on the road, it\u0026rsquo;s essentially a wasted day.\nDay 9 Lalibela The fabled rock-hewn churches of Lalibela, twelve monolithic masterpieces carved directly into the mountain.\nWhen I arrived, the entrance price had jumped from $50 to $100.\nGuides are extra (5–50 USD depending on the priest), and\u0026hellip; most priests now carry iPhones.\nTheir greed sicken me.\nBeware of fake priests: they\u0026rsquo;ll offer cheap tours, but can\u0026rsquo;t explain the ceremonies, or even where they “work.”\nStill, nothing diminishes the awe.\nWalking barefoot through dim tunnels carved in rock, hearing prayers echo, it\u0026rsquo;s timeless.\nDay 10 Lalibela (Monasteries) Another day around Lalibela!\nI visited surrounding monasteries and met locals. The dude working at my hotel\u0026rsquo;s reception was quite nice and showed me around (for a price, of course) Other than the monasteries and revisiting the rock church, I advise you to eat at Ben Abeba, a scottish fusion restaurant in a nice area.\nDay 11 Lalibela to Harar Quick flight to Dire Dawa, then shuttle to Harar.\nIf you take the bus route instead (two full days via Dessie), be prepared for a whole bunch of nothing.\nJames did it, said it was disappointing, Dessie had nothing to do and the road was shitty.\nHarar felt different, with its arabic influences, colorful walls and stronger tourism industry. Add to that the smell of Harari coffee, it sure is nicer. I arrived a bit late in the day, despite the flights, so I mostly enjoyed dinner and slept.\nDay 12 Harar ^ Harar with Solomon\nOld stone alleys, green chat leaves, and the instagram-famous hyena feeding.\nAround early noon, I met Solomon, a witty Rasta-looking man who works part-time at a museum.\nIf he offers to guide you, he\u0026rsquo;s the real deal. Not a scammer.\nYou can even find him online, but this feels outdated: Solomon Harar, Ethiopia\nWe talked for hours about history and his life, with my friend James we toured the whole walled city, went people watching, enjoyed street food\u0026hellip; And we met him again in the evening to see the hyenas, he showed us more cool things during the night. Truly the best.\nNote: He might have moved to Israel with his wife, I met him in 2023, the ticker ticks, people move The ebbs and flows of life take people to the waves and the clouds.\n^Harar without Solomon, but James\u0026rsquo; cameo\nDay 13 Return to Addis Ababa I didn\u0026rsquo;t take the train, buses suited our timing better (we departed at night to get time in Addis).\nTerrible choice. I got stuck beside a fat muslim woman over 100 kg, sweating rivers and stiking like poo. The ride felt eternal, the mercury went up to 47°C around midway.\nEthiopian hates opening windows in cars, something about bad luck, I think? That\u0026rsquo;s why I recommend taking the train, + it\u0026rsquo;s french infrastructure.\nThat night, I went out with my chinese travel partner to Yob Abyssinia, a traditional restaurant, famous on Google Maps.\nIt was fun seeing the dances and being invited on stage! The food was meh, though.\nOn the way back, we got robbed (James\u0026rsquo; phone got stollen by three big guys, it turned into a fistfight, which we easily won.\nWe were two and they were only three, lol. Not a dull moment in Addis. Never\u0026hellip;\nAddis is full of prostitutes, robbers and glue sniffers, I don\u0026rsquo;t advise walking at night. Some robbers have knives. Unless you are strong enough to fend two weapon-wielding low lives, be careful.\nDay 14 Arba Minch From Addis, a long bus ride south toward Arba Minch, gateway to the Omo Valley.\nThere, James and I got approached by Miju, a Hamar guide with missing teeth.\nWe visited the town and around, see the lakes and the crocodiles. Apart from shopping for tours, the only real good thing to do is to see the Dorze tribe. I did it on the next day, so once again, it was pretty much a wasted day.\nTo find a guide, ask for Nairobi. He\u0026rsquo;s the leader, he may not always work as a guide, but apparently he\u0026rsquo;s the best. If he\u0026rsquo;s busy, he\u0026rsquo;ll recommend you someone else. That\u0026rsquo;s how I ended up with Miju.\nDays 15 to 17 Omo Valley Tribes ^Miju in the market\nYou have a choice of transportation. I did mine.\nWith my guide, we rode motorbikes and hitched trucks after the second day since Miju was too lazy/tired to drive.\nOn the first day, I visited the Dorze, drank with the king and watched demos of cooking methods. As well as tasted dishes and alcohol.\nOn the second and third day, we met the Hamar, Mursi, and Konso tribes, each with their customs, beauty, and dignity.\nAnd perhaps more, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to remember all the names.\nThe best things to do are:\nGoing to local markets Go people watching Drink and eat with locals Party I liked the lifestyle.\nEven if they are naked in hut, I noticed they all have phones with online games on it. So, yeah, you will see young people playing PUBG and fortnite. Technologia!\nIn Turmi, I got into another street fight, but out of respect for the guides and the Omo valley tourism industry, I\u0026rsquo;ll leave the details out.\n^A tribe in the wild\nDay 18 Konso to Moyale We ended the trip in Konso because I planned to go to Moyale, the border crossing into Kenya.\nTravel advisories mark this area in red, tribal tensions still run deep.\nGunfire between tribes isn\u0026rsquo;t rare, and foreigners should avoid nighttimes.\nThe trip was busy and dusty, people were fighting to get into buses, the border was closed early, I had to sleep in one of the shittiest hotel I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen. No toilets or showers, no water. Just a bed filled with cockroaches. 10€. Take it or leave it.\nMore? If you visit Ethiopia, I recommend skipping Bahir Dar to see Dalol. Or if you have more time, squeeze it somewhere. The issue with Ethiopia is that the roads are terrible, so everything goes through Addis, a real shithole.\nFinal Thoughts Ethiopia is a country that demands patience and respect (and a taste for street fights).\nIt\u0026rsquo;s chaotic, corrupt, alive, and endlessly complex, but it\u0026rsquo;s also one of the last places where travel still feels wild. I don\u0026rsquo;t recommend it, but if you\u0026rsquo;re keen for it, I hope that my itinerary will be of use.\nComments?\n","date":"August 15, 2023","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cpicture\u003e\n          \u003csource\n            \n              srcset=\"/images/blog/eth0b_hu_5d65b10d667ebff9.webp\"\n            \n            media=\"(max-width: 575px)\" /\u003e\n          \u003csource\n            \n              srcset=\"/images/blog/eth0b_hu_ca5c305434da6d6a.webp\"\n            \n            media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" /\u003e\n          \u003csource\n            \n              srcset=\"/images/blog/eth0b_hu_a114dff0ff121148.webp\"\n            \n            media=\"(max-width: 991px)\" /\u003e\n          \u003csource\n            \n              srcset=\"/images/blog/eth0b_hu_e9f41a5eda856700.webp\"\n             /\u003e\n          \u003cimg\n            \n              loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n              src=\"/images/blog/eth0b_hu_36ba5fd23f744ff.jpg\"\n            \n            \n            class=\"  img\"\n            alt=\"\"\n            width=\"1365\"\n            height=\"768\" /\u003e\n        \u003c/picture\u003e\n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n","permalink":"/blog/itinerary-ethiopia/","title":"3 weeks in Ethiopia"},{"categories":["Itinerary","Africa"],"contents":" Tanzania, Kenya, Ouganda \u0026amp; Rwanda: 4 Countries in one month!\n\u0026gt; As I\u0026rsquo;m starting with this blog, I\u0026rsquo;ll share in a slightly different format.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll start with my usual considerations before giving an itinerary outline and an even more detailed version of the itinerary.\noriginally, it was supposed to last one more week, it changed due to a awful event that happened And shook me up, I\u0026rsquo;ll specify the section that has been changed.\n(Loading test, there is a cross-site cookie issue on my dev server)\nBefore diving into my itinerary, a few considerations:\nEnglish is the Lingua Franca in the region, but in Rwanda many people speak french instead I actually came from Ethiopia, crossing through Kenya using the Moyale border Backpacking is not a big thing in East Africa It might be dangerous at times, I don\u0026rsquo;t recommend going alone It\u0026rsquo;s by no mean a cheap destination Info is hard to get online, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to bring as much useful intel I can Prices date from 2023, might have hiked up in the meantime ____\nNote: This article detailing logistic can be a nice read as well\nTips on how to travel Africa I got this one too, for Cheap safaris!\nTips for Cheap Safaris Itinerary done quick 🇹🇿 TANZANIA Day Destination Notes Day 1 Arusha Arrival, Safari prep Day 2 Arusha - Tarangire Safari - Tarangire Day 3 Arusha - Ngorongoro Safari - Ngorongoro Day 4 Arusha - Manyara Safari - Manyara Day 5 Moshi Transfer Day 6 Moshi Hike foot of Kilimanjaro Day 7 Lushoto Scenic drive Day 8 Lushoto Hiking Day 9 Zanzibar Long bus Dar + ferry Day 10 Zanzibar - Stone Town Stone Town Day 11 Zanzibar - Prison Island Prison island + sand beach Day 12 Zanzibar - Spices Spice tour + boat in the evening Day 13 Kilwa Masoko South coast Day 14 Kilwa Kisiwani Ruins visit Day 15 Kilwa Kivanje Around Kilwa Day 16 Dar es Salaam Return + visit Day 17 Bagamoyo Stopover 🇰🇪 KENYA Day Destination Notes Day 18 Mombasa Border crossing Day 19 Mombasa Old town \u0026amp; more Day 20 Nairobi - Train Afternoon train Day 21 Nairobi Explore Day 22 Nairobi - NP Day trip to National Park 🇺🇬 UGANDA Day Destination Notes Day 23 Kampala Long road into Uganda + city Day 24 Kampala City day Day 25 Fort Portal Long transfer Day 26 Rwenzori Trek Day 27 Rwenzori Trek Day 28 Kabale The worst road\u0026hellip; Day 29 Lake Bunyoni Lake Bunyonyi 1 Day 30 Lake Bunyoni Lake Bunyonyi 2 🇷🇼 RWANDA Day Destination Notes Day 31 Kigali Enter Rwanda, rest Day 32 Kigali Enjoy the city Day 33 Ruhengeri Arrive and prepare Day 34 Volcanoes NP Volcanoes/Gorillas Day 35 Kibuye Get to see Lake Kivu Day 36 Kigali Departure That\u0026rsquo;s it! Do click on the links (destination name) to learn more!\nTanzania Day 1 Arrival in Arusha Most travelers land at Kilimanjaro Airport and reach Arusha by shuttle, some cross the border from Kenya (There are border transfer services, it last around 6 hours and it was an easy border. Be prepared to have a lot of people selling you stuff) And other takes a long bus from Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania\u0026rsquo;s capital. Apparently it\u0026rsquo;s a gruesome 10 hours. Otherwise, it\u0026rsquo;s a bit less than 3 hours from Moshi.\nI actually came by land from Moyale in Ethiopia. It took me two days and a half, in retrospect, that was a stupid move. (For those interested (???) I went Konso -\u0026gt; Yabelo -\u0026gt; Moyale -\u0026gt; Slept at the border -\u0026gt; Marsabit -\u0026gt; Nairobi -\u0026gt; Slept in the streets -\u0026gt; Arusha) I saw a lot of landscapes along the way and did encounter funny people, strange locals and saw tribes out and about, it\u0026rsquo;s part of the adventure.\nAnyway, use the afternoon to get oriented, withdraw a good amount of cash, VERY IMPORTANT TO DO buy a local SIM (Vodacom or Airtel), and check a few safari agencies. I like to do my \u0026ldquo;shopping\u0026rdquo; with local agencies, even though prices are pretty much aligned.\nMore tips here (I\u0026rsquo;m lazy, I won\u0026rsquo;t C-Paste my content): Tips for Cheap Safaris. Join a group with a local operator: it\u0026rsquo;s easy to arrange last minute, and you can get three-days safaris under 500€.\nArusha isn\u0026rsquo;t the prettiest city, there aren\u0026rsquo;t a lot of sights: a few Hindu temples, gardens and a couple of art centers; I\u0026rsquo;d say that it\u0026rsquo;s more than enough for an afternoon.\nWelcome to Africa btw.\nDay 2 Arusha – Safari (Tarangire) I went on a three days safari with the local agency linked to the Arusha Backpackers hostel, (I don\u0026rsquo;t remember the name), A Tunisian guy, Bessa - owner of the first hostel in Tunis helped me, out with the negociations. It\u0026rsquo;s always better negociating with a friend.\nSafaris starts early. Expect a long drive into Tarangire, a forested area famous for its elephants (see the picture). The day was kinda long, but it was a blast, very reminescent of Thoiry back home (it\u0026rsquo;s a drive-in Zoo). It was my first real safari and that was really exciting, I was beaming!\nYour guide will help you spot all the wildlife, but they will normally remain pretty far from the animals, especially if they are a licensed guide that respect this very same wildlife.\nI slept in a tent in a camp, where I listened to Jambo Bwana for the first time. It was fun and simple.\nThe big five can be spotted right from the first day, if ya lucky\nDay 3 Arusha – Safari (Ngorongoro) Wake up before sunrise to enter the Ngorongoro Crater.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a long descent into a massive bowl of wildlife, in the coldest of morning. When I went it was overly misty: Visibility was shit. The first few hours were rough and we missed the migration by weeks, changes in weather patterns messed things up\u0026hellip;\nSee the picture for the view/weather. Not that bad, actually, right? We spotted wildlife every 5 minutes or something, it felt like a railshooter. Anyone played Pokemon Snap before? That\u0026rsquo;s the feeling.\nWe camped near the Crater\u0026rsquo;s rim. You can hear the animals at night, noice.\nFact: Technically, the Ngorongoro is part of the Serengeti, even though it\u0026rsquo;s a different NP\nFact 2: The name is supposedly the sound of a bell\nDay 4 Arusha – Safari (Manyara) Final day of my safari, visiting Lake Manyara National Park.\nFewer crowds and good birdlife + Monke. It was my less favorite. I got tired after the first few hours. Safaris are not for me, they get exhausting after a while/\nManyara is home to the tree climbing lions, have fun trying to spot them!\nDay 5 Road to Moshi In the morning, I went to see the waterfalls near Arusha. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t worth it, folks try to make you pay every half hour and they are boring. So\u0026hellip; Take a morning bus or shared minivan to Moshi (2–3 h).\nThey are easy to find near the main bus station in Arusha, people will propose you the bus even if you don\u0026rsquo;t ask anyway.\nThe town of Moshi sits at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro. That\u0026rsquo;s the target. If you\u0026rsquo;re lucky, you might see it in its full glory.\nI went in the later afternoon, it was a hard mistake. Always arrive at your destination during day time.\nStory time: I came at night, had no sim card (I forgot) and my hostel (Mad Vervet Moshi) was a junkie nest where someone kidnapped me and forcefully brought me to an hotel with naked guys. So\u0026hellip; Avoid, be careful, don\u0026rsquo;t go alone. Be safe. This is no joke.\nDay 6 Moshi Shaken by the event of the day before I just went on a half-day hike around Materuni Falls, at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro.\nI met a nice man, that helped me immensely and spent time with his family. A nice \u0026ldquo;tuk-tuk\u0026rdquo; driver with a heart of Gold. I also switched hotel and found a safer place.\nStory time 2: I had been with the police the night before. Had a contact with them, but they were off. In a restaurant, far from the crime, Another policeman talked to me, heard about the case, gave me his phone number and all. Said it was just in case, to keep me safe, as the police deals in dark trades. Actually, he just wanted to you-know-what. I had to block him due to the almost nude pictures of himself he sent me. Thrice. He called with different numbers and tried to find me in the city.\nDay 7 Road to Lushoto I took a bus, early in the morning, trying to escape the dense gay policeman.\nIt was a long ride (6–7 h) through the mountains toward Lushoto in the Usambara Hills.\nThat part of my trip is blurry. I can\u0026rsquo;t recall much. I slept in a new hostel by the road, a bit higher than the town. A man named Emanuel and his family settled there and do honey keeping. I shared meals with them as well as watch a few show on the local TV.\nDay 8 Lushoto ^A view of Lushoto from the heights\nI Spent the day hiking to the Irente Viewpoint. The trail was nice, going through nature fror some bits and through local villages with nice kids greeting you at every opportunity. All of this was still a blur for me.\nDay 9 Road to Zanzibar ^Dar-Es-Salaam seen from the dock\nI caught a morning bus toward Dar es Salaam (6 hours?), then the ferry to Zanzibar (2 hours?).\nTo get the bus, I asked Emmanuel, the hostel owner to call the company and they picked me up in front of the hostel. It was super late and took forever to reach Dar, more than it was supposed to. I arrived around 3:30/4:00 PM and caught a ferry by taking a motorbike from the first bus station, I was scared of being late\u0026hellip; But, I made it in time, with half an hour of earliness to validate my ticket and everything.\nCareful at the docks, there are many places selling fake tickets, hundreds of scammers and weirdoes. I had to fight my way through, it was physical.\nThe trip is relaxing and comfy, the waves hadn\u0026rsquo;t started yet. Expect to arrive by evening to visit the beautiful Stone Town after dark; it\u0026rsquo;s safer and lively.\nDay 10 Stone Town ^The dispensary in Old town, it\u0026rsquo;s a medical center\nExplore the maze of Stone Town by daylight: the Old Fort, the markets, and the sea promenade.\nI ate at Forodhani Gardens, where locals grill food every night, it\u0026rsquo;s overrated. For lunch I went to a local shop and had much better food. Small hole in the wall without a name. Ate there for most meals afterwards.\nI recommend seeing the Jail for some hardcore history, the fort to see the activities (it\u0026rsquo;s lively), the palaces, eventually Freddy Mercury house, and\u0026hellip; just enjoy!\nI liked Stone Town quite a bit.\nI saw the sellers in the famous market shit behind their stall, close to the merchandise 🤮\nDay 11 Prison Island and Beach ^For the beach lovers\nTake a boat/tour to Prison Island to see the giant tortoises and the jail then spend the afternoon on one of the nearby sandbanks or beaches.\nI found a local agency at the fort with good tours, they were a blast to speak with (Jambo tour or smth like that) and where neatly organized.\n(If you want more comfort and relaxation, base yourself in Nungwi or Paje for the next days. I heard good things, except for the male prostitutes)\nDay 12 Spice Tour Join a spice tour inland! I went with the same tour company as the day before. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit touristy, but worth it for the smells and samples (Plus, I was alone, so I had my very own private tour to the farm) That\u0026rsquo;s a good half day spent for something important.\nIn the evening, hop on a small dhow boat for sunset and/or return to Dar. I did the later as my bus left very early.\nDay 13 Road to Kilwa Masoko Ferry back to Dar, then catch a southbound bus (8–9 h) toward Kilwa Masoko.\nThere were two bus to Kilwa: One leaves at 5:30, the other at noon. There might be other companies, but I have no intel on those. To get the bus I mototaxied to the station Mbagala Rangi Tatu and caught the bus at 7AM (Might have been late). At the bus station, there were those balls snacks that the Malagasy often make, it\u0026rsquo;s bloody delicious!\nThe road was long and without any major sight, everything looked the same until the azure coast. Onward it\u0026rsquo;s just villages, with a lovely pace of life.\nAfter a long time I reached the hostel: The Slow Leopard. Absolutely amazing quality! They also have another location in Dar, I definitely recommend it.\nI spent the evening relaxing and shopping for tours to Kilwa Kisiwani. I ended up going with the tourism information center, this was the most obvious choice.\nDay 14 Kilwa Kisiwani I\u0026rsquo;m bad at taking pictures, and the sun wasn\u0026rsquo;t nice to me.\nVisit the Kilwa Kisiwani ruins: once a major Swahili trading port and a World Wonder in Sid Meier\u0026rsquo;s Civilization VI. Yes, that\u0026rsquo;s why I went.\nWe got a boat for two (I met a scientist along the way) We were only two tourists!\nIt\u0026rsquo;s calm, scenic and pictures can\u0026rsquo;t do it justice\u0026hellip; It was expensive, quite a detour and exhausting, but I don\u0026rsquo;t regret it.\nDay 15 Kilwa Kivanje I visited the nearby Kilwas with the guide from the tourism bureau. It\u0026rsquo;s not particularily interesting, but I was a much cheaper visit and it was relaxing. I then spent the evening relaxing at the beach. You\u0026rsquo;ll need that before continuing your way south to Mozambique or back north to Kenya.\nDay 16 Back to Dar es Salaam Return north (6–7 h).\nIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t yet, explore Dar-Es-Salam a bit. I didn\u0026rsquo;t really like the city, it had no soul. But I had to waste a day here (So two days of transport wasted to See Kilwa, do what you want)\nDar is known for being a bit unsafe, be careful if visiting alone\nDay 17 Bagamoyo Short bus from Dar (1h 30 min).\nBagamoyo is a small coastal town with colonial buildings, it\u0026rsquo;s like Lamu or Tanga: A typical Swahili coast city.\nA quiet final stop before crossing into Kenya and a good way to slightly break the trip. To sleep, either: In Bagamoyo, back to Dar, or in Tanga, a bit more north.\nWhat did I do? I don\u0026rsquo;t know\u0026hellip; I relapsed a bit and the blur started again.\nDay 18 Road to Mombasa Early bus through Lunga Lunga border post.\nExpect an almost full-day ride and an arrival in Mombasa by evening.\nFind accommodation near the Old Town: There aren\u0026rsquo;t many places for backpackers. I found one on top of a restaurant, it was on GMaps, but I can\u0026rsquo;t find it anymore. It was held by a nice lady.\nSaw some people shitting in the streets in the middle of everything 🤮\nKenya Day 19 Mombasa Explore Fort Jesus, the Old Town\u0026rsquo;s narrow lanes, eat Swahili street food, see the thousands bats, the sculptures\u0026hellip;\nBut don\u0026rsquo;t take pictures of the government building, even though they are very Heritage, it\u0026rsquo;s forbidden.\nDay 20 Road to Nairobi Take the SGR train to Nairobi (6 h).\nBut be warned, the station security is airport like and it\u0026rsquo;s 10km out of town.\nPrepare to be there early!\nModern, air-conditioned, surprisingly punctual\u0026hellip; Relax and enjoy the scenery and the modernity.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re lucky, you can spot wildlife from your window, especially elephants, girafes and zebras.\nDay 21 Nairobi Arrive and get used to the city again.\nWalk around the center and see the National Museum.\nCareful, they will make you pay twice if you don\u0026rsquo;t pay attention, they took my card, swiped it twice, I got charged twice. They threw the other receipt in the bin, bunch of loosers.\nI slept at the YHA, it was full of weirdos and fanatics.\nThe streets were littered with people drugged out of their minds and some people tried to rob me. A lot of street harassment too\u0026hellip;\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re brave, visit. If you aren\u0026rsquo;t avoid.\nDay 22 Nairobi2 Book a half-day tour to Nairobi National Park, it\u0026rsquo;s right outside the city.\nOr see the giraffe mansion, the Karen Blixen Museum or whatever floats your boat.\nDay trips to the national parks outside of the Nairobi NP are crazy expansive. The Hell\u0026rsquo;s gate NP is like 150€+ for a day. Jesus Heckin\u0026rsquo; Christ.\nSpend the late afternoon preparing for the long road to Uganda. I took a night bus.\nUganda Day 23 Road to Kampala Bus north through the Busia border (12h +).\nDo take a night bus, it\u0026rsquo;s better.\nArrive in Kampala in the afternoon, visit the Gaddafi Mosque near the bus station or go to your hotel and visit whatever you want. It depends on your energy.\nKampala is crazy busy. Taking motorbike rides is especially crazy, no wonder there are a lot of road accidents and death. They call them boda-bodas here. But sometimes, I still say Tuk-Tuk.\nDay 24 Kampala Two options: Go to Jinja for rafting. Or, like me, visit the city a bit more in depth. I went to the Kasubi tombs, I checked viewpoints, ate some rolled eggs, saw the Hindu temple, rode Boda bodas at my life\u0026rsquo;s peril\u0026hellip;\nThe city is chaotic but friendly, but walking is suicidal.\nDay 25 Road to Fort Portal Early departure west (7–8 h).\nFort Portal is green, with views of the Rwenzori Mountains.\nThere isn\u0026rsquo;t much to see, so I ate and went further in the mountains, through a road in construction to get to my hostel.\nDay 26 Rwenzori Mountains Trek or hike shorter routes near the base.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re not climbing fully, there are beautiful day trails around Ruboni Village. Otherwise, try to get to a good altitude to see the unique plants.\nDay 27 Rwenzori Mountains Second day of hiking. You can sleep in one of the lodge then go higher to see the plants and stuff! Honestly, it\u0026rsquo;s one of the prettiest part of Eaast Africa.\nRwenzoris means moon mountains. What a lovely name!\nDay 28 Road to Kabale Rough day on bad roads.\nIt was like 12 hours, I got stuck at the back of a 12 seaters with 20 people. A big black guy, sitting on my lap, a girl vomitting just in front of me, the only openable window open right next to me, with stops lasting hours and autists trying to touch me or grab me.\nIt was genuinely awful. But at the time I went there, there were no other ways direct from the Rwenzoris.\nA better/nicer option might be to go back to Kampala\u0026hellip;\nDay 29 Lake Bunyonyi Arrive by noon and take a small boat across Lake Bunyonyi.\nQuiet, scenic, dotted with small islands.\nA perfect spot to rest and read!\nDay 30 Lake Bunyonyi 2 Second day on the lake.\nKayak, read, and recharge before entering Rwanda. I really needed this rest, and so did many travelers.\nRwanda Day 31 Road to Kigali Cross the border at Katuna.\nSmooth and organized.\nArrive in Kigali by afternoon; it\u0026rsquo;s clean, hilly and calm. I decided to relax.\nDay 32 Kigali Visit the Genocide Memorial, check a cafe or eat some Rolex (Rolled eggs) and the see the conference center.\nThe city is spotless and easy to navigate with moto-taxis. Be warned, the memorial is hardcore.\nThere aren\u0026rsquo;t many things to see in Kigali, but I love it.\nGood Read: Petit Pays from Gael Faye is a must, if you want to understand the life of those who survived the genocide, it explains things nicely\nDay 33 Ruhengeri Bus north (3h30 min).\nGateway to Volcanoes National Park.\nCooler weather, nice mountain views, but nothing else; Do what you can with your free time, I decided to read, play video games and eat in restaurants.\nDay 34 Volcanoes NP Gorilla trekking if your budget allows and you want to support wildlife or\u0026hellip; See them for free by doing the caldera day hike. If ya lucky, that\u0026rsquo;s it. I met a traveler that did it the day before I did and had great pictures of gorillas.\nCareful of the gorilla scam, locals will tell you they have a way to see gorillas for \u0026ldquo;cheap\u0026rdquo;. Apparently, there will never be gorillas.

Do click on the links (destination name) to learn more!\nUganda Day 1 Road to Kampala Arrive in Kampala when you can, visit the Gaddafi Mosque near the bus station or go to your hotel and visit whatever you want. It depends on your energy.\nKampala is crazy busy. Taking motorbike rides is especially crazy, no wonder there are a lot of road accidents and death. They call them boda-bodas here. But sometimes, I still say Tuk-Tuk.\nDay 2 Kampala Two options: Go to Jinja for rafting. Or, like me, visit the city a bit more in depth. I went to the Kasubi tombs, I checked viewpoints, ate some rolled eggs, saw the Hindu temple, rode Boda bodas at my life\u0026rsquo;s peril\u0026hellip;\nThe city is chaotic but friendly, but walking is suicidal.\nDay 3 Road to Fort Portal Early departure west (7–8 h).\nFort Portal is green, with views of the Rwenzori Mountains.\nThere isn\u0026rsquo;t much to see, so I ate and went further in the mountains, through a road in construction to get to my hostel.\nDay 4 Rwenzori Mountains Trek or hike shorter routes near the base.\nIf you’re not climbing fully, there are beautiful day trails around Ruboni Village. Otherwise, try to get to a good altitude to see the unique plants.\nDay 5 Rwenzori Mountains Second day of hiking. You can sleep in one of the lodge then go higher to see the plants and stuff! Honestly, it\u0026rsquo;s one of the prettiest part of Eaast Africa.\nRwenzoris means moon mountains. What a lovely name!\nDay 6 Road to Kabale Rough day on bad roads.\nIt was like 12 hours, I got stuck at the back of a 12 seaters with 20 people. A big black guy, sitting on my lap, a girl vomitting just in front of me, the only openable window open right next to me, with stops lasting hours and autists trying to touch me or grab me.\nIt was genuinely awful. But at the time I went there, there were no other ways direct from the Rwenzoris.\nA better/nicer option might be to go back to Kampala\u0026hellip;\nDay 7 Lake Bunyonyi Arrive by noon and take a small boat across Lake Bunyonyi.\nQuiet, scenic, dotted with small islands.\nA perfect spot to rest and read!\nDay 8 Lake Bunyonyi 2 Second day on the lake.\nKayak, read, and recharge before entering Rwanda.

Do click on the links (destination name) to learn more!\nTanzania Day 1 Arrival in Arusha Most travelers land at Kilimanjaro Airport and reach Arusha by shuttle, some cross the border from Kenya (There are border transfer services, it last around 6 hours and it was an easy border. Be prepared to have a lot of people selling you stuff) And other takes a long bus from Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania\u0026rsquo;s capital. Apparently it\u0026rsquo;s a gruesome 10 hours. Otherwise, it\u0026rsquo;s a bit less than 3 hours from Moshi.\nI actually came by land from Moyale in Ethiopia. It took me two days and a half, in retrospect, that was a stupid move. (For those interested (???) I went Konso -\u0026gt; Yabelo -\u0026gt; Moyale -\u0026gt; Slept at the border -\u0026gt; Marsabit -\u0026gt; Nairobi -\u0026gt; Slept in the streets -\u0026gt; Arusha) I saw a lot of landscapes along the way and did encounter funny people, strange locals and saw tribes out and about, it\u0026rsquo;s part of the adventure.\nAnyway, use the afternoon to get oriented, withdraw a good amount of cash, VERY IMPORTANT TO DO buy a local SIM (Vodacom or Airtel), and check a few safari agencies. I like to do my \u0026ldquo;shopping\u0026rdquo; with local agencies, even though prices are pretty much aligned.\nMore tips here (I\u0026rsquo;m lazy, I won\u0026rsquo;t C-Paste my content): Tips for Cheap Safaris. Join a group with a local operator: it\u0026rsquo;s easy to arrange last minute, and you can get three-days safaris under 500€.\nArusha isn\u0026rsquo;t the prettiest city, there aren\u0026rsquo;t a lot of sights: a few Hindu temples, gardens and a couple of art centers; I\u0026rsquo;d say that it\u0026rsquo;s more than enough for an afternoon.\nWelcome to Africa btw.\nDay 2 Arusha – Safari (Tarangire) I went on a three days safari with the local agency linked to the Arusha Backpackers hostel, (I don\u0026rsquo;t remember the name), A Tunisian guy, Bessa - owner of the first hostel in Tunis helped me, out with the negociations. It\u0026rsquo;s always better negociating with a friend.\nSafaris starts early. Expect a long drive into Tarangire, a forested area famous for its elephants (see the picture). The day was kinda long, but it was a blast, very reminescent of Thoiry back home (it\u0026rsquo;s a drive-in Zoo). It was my first real safari and that was really exciting, I was beaming!\nYour guide will help you spot all the wildlife, but they will normally remain pretty far from the animals, especially if they are a licensed guide that respect this very same wildlife.\nI slept in a tent in a camp, where I listened to Jambo Bwana for the first time. It was fun and simple.\nThe big five can be spotted right from the first day, if ya lucky\nDay 3 Arusha – Safari (Ngorongoro) Wake up before sunrise to enter the Ngorongoro Crater.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a long descent into a massive bowl of wildlife, in the coldest of morning. When I went it was overly misty: Visibility was shit. The first few hours were rough and we missed the migration by weeks, changes in weather patterns messed things up\u0026hellip;\nSee the picture for the view/weather. Not that bad, actually, right? We spotted wildlife every 5 minutes or something, it felt like a railshooter. Anyone played Pokemon Snap before? That\u0026rsquo;s the feeling.\nWe camped near the Crater\u0026rsquo;s rim. You can hear the animals at night, noice.\nFact: Technically, the Ngorongoro is part of the Serengeti, even though it\u0026rsquo;s a different NP\nFact 2: The name is supposedly the sound of a bell\nDay 4 Arusha – Safari (Manyara) Final day of my safari, visiting Lake Manyara National Park.\nFewer crowds and good birdlife + Monke. It was my less favorite. I got tired after the first few hours. Safaris are not for me, they get exhausting after a while/\nManyara is home to the tree climbing lions, have fun trying to spot them!\nDay 5 Road to Moshi In the morning, I went to see the waterfalls near Arusha. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t worth it, folks try to make you pay every half hour and they are boring. So\u0026hellip; Take a morning bus or shared minivan to Moshi (2–3 h).\nThey are easy to find near the main bus station in Arusha, people will propose you the bus even if you don\u0026rsquo;t ask anyway.\nThe town of Moshi sits at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro. That\u0026rsquo;s the target. If you\u0026rsquo;re lucky, you might see it in its full glory.\nI went in the later afternoon, it was a hard mistake. Always arrive at your destination during day time.\nStory time: I came at night, had no sim card (I forgot) and my hostel (Mad Vervet Moshi) was a junkie nest where someone kidnapped me and forcefully brought me to an hotel with naked guys. So\u0026hellip; Avoid, be careful, don\u0026rsquo;t go alone. Be safe. This is no joke.\nDay 6 Moshi Shaken by the event of the day before I just went on a half-day hike around Materuni Falls, at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro.\nI met a nice man, that helped me immensely and spent time with his family. A nice \u0026ldquo;tuk-tuk\u0026rdquo; driver with a heart of Gold. I also switched hotel and found a safer place.\nStory time 2: I had been with the police the night before. Had a contact with them, but they were off. In a restaurant, far from the crime, Another policeman talked to me, heard about the case, gave me his phone number and all. Said it was just in case, to keep me safe, as the police deals in dark trades. Actually, he just wanted to you-know-what. I had to block him due to the almost nude pictures of himself he sent me. Thrice. He called with different numbers and tried to find me in the city.\nDay 7 Road to Lushoto I took a bus, early in the morning, trying to escape the dense gay policeman.\nIt was a long ride (6–7 h) through the mountains toward Lushoto in the Usambara Hills.\nThat part of my trip is blurry. I can\u0026rsquo;t recall much. I slept in a new hostel by the road, a bit higher than the town. A man named Emanuel and his family settled there and do honey keeping. I shared meals with them as well as watch a few show on the local TV.\nDay 8 Lushoto A view of Lushoto from the heights\nI Spent the day hiking to the Irente Viewpoint. The trail was nice, going through nature fror some bits and through local villages with nice kids greeting you at every opportunity. All of this was still a blur for me.\nDay 9 Road to Zanzibar Dar-Es-Salaam seen from the dock\nI caught a morning bus toward Dar es Salaam (6 hours?), then the ferry to Zanzibar (2 hours?).\nTo get the bus, I asked Emmanuel, the hostel owner to call the company and they picked me up in front of the hostel. It was super late and took forever to reach Dar, more than it was supposed to. I arrived around 3:30/4:00 PM and caught a ferry by taking a motorbike from the first bus station, I was scared of being late\u0026hellip; But, I made it in time, with half an hour of earliness to validate my ticket and everything.\nCareful at the docks, there are many places selling fake tickets, hundreds of scammers and weirdoes. I had to fight my way through, it was physical.\nThe trip is relaxing and comfy, the waves hadn\u0026rsquo;t started yet. Expect to arrive by evening to visit the beautiful Stone Town after dark; it\u0026rsquo;s safer and lively.\nDay 10 Stone Town The dispensary in Old town, it\u0026rsquo;s a medical center\nExplore the maze of Stone Town by daylight: the Old Fort, the markets, and the sea promenade.\nI ate at Forodhani Gardens, where locals grill food every night, it\u0026rsquo;s overrated. For lunch I went to a local shop and had much better food. Small hole in the wall without a name. Ate there for most meals afterwards.\nI recommend seeing the Jail for some hardcore history, the fort to see the activities (it\u0026rsquo;s lively), the palaces, eventually Freddy Mercury house, and\u0026hellip; just enjoy!\nI liked Stone Town quite a bit.\nI saw the sellers in the famous market shit behind their stall, close to the merchandise 🤮\nDay 11 Prison Island and Beach For the beach lovers\nTake a boat/tour to Prison Island to see the giant tortoises and the jail then spend the afternoon on one of the nearby sandbanks or beaches.\nI found a local agency at the fort with good tours, they were a blast to speak with (Jambo tour or smth like that) and where neatly organized.\n(If you want more comfort and relaxation, base yourself in Nungwi or Paje for the next days. I heard good things, except for the male prostitutes)\nDay 12 Spice Tour Join a spice tour inland! I went with the same tour company as the day before. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit touristy, but worth it for the smells and samples (Plus, I was alone, so I had my very own private tour to the farm) That\u0026rsquo;s a good half day spent for something important.\nIn the evening, hop on a small dhow boat for sunset and/or return to Dar. I did the later as my bus left very early.\nDay 13 Road to Kilwa Masoko Ferry back to Dar, then catch a southbound bus (8–9 h) toward Kilwa Masoko.\nThere were two bus to Kilwa: One leaves at 5:30, the other at noon. There might be other companies, but I have no intel on those. To get the bus I mototaxied to the station Mbagala Rangi Tatu and caught the bus at 7AM (Might have been late). At the bus station, there were those balls snacks that the Malagasy often make, it\u0026rsquo;s bloody delicious!\nThe road was long and without any major sight, everything looked the same until the azure coast. Onward it\u0026rsquo;s just villages, with a lovely pace of life.\nAfter a long time I reached the hostel: The Slow Leopard. Absolutely amazing quality! They also have another location in Dar, I definitely recommend it.\nI spent the evening relaxing and shopping for tours to Kilwa Kisiwani. I ended up going with the tourism information center, this was the most obvious choice.\nDay 14 Kilwa Kisiwani I\u0026rsquo;m bad at taking pictures, and the sun wasn\u0026rsquo;t nice to me.\nVisit the Kilwa Kisiwani ruins: once a major Swahili trading port and a World Wonder in Sid Meier\u0026rsquo;s Civilization VI. Yes, that\u0026rsquo;s why I went.\nWe got a boat for two (I met a scientist along the way) We were only two tourists!\nIt\u0026rsquo;s calm, scenic and pictures can\u0026rsquo;t do it justice\u0026hellip; It was expensive, quite a detour and exhausting, but I don\u0026rsquo;t regret it.\nDay 15 Kilwa Kivanje I visited the nearby Kilwas with the guide from the tourism bureau. It\u0026rsquo;s not particularily interesting, but I was a much cheaper visit and it was relaxing. I then spent the evening relaxing at the beach. You\u0026rsquo;ll need that before continuing your way south to Mozambique or back north to Kenya.\nDay 16 Back to Dar es Salaam Return north (6–7 h).\nIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t yet, explore Dar-Es-Salam a bit. I didn\u0026rsquo;t really like the city, it had no soul. But I had to waste a day here (So two days of transport wasted to See Kilwa, do what you want)\nDar is known for being a bit unsafe, be careful if visiting alone\nDay 17 Bagamoyo Short bus from Dar (1h 30 min).\nBagamoyo is a small coastal town with colonial buildings, it\u0026rsquo;s like Lamu or Tanga: A typical Swahili coast city.\nA quiet final stop before crossing into Kenya and a good way to slightly break the trip. To sleep, either: In Bagamoyo, back to Dar, or in Tanga, a bit more north.\nComments?

If you\u0026rsquo;re static, you will get cold. The winter season is less windy than summer\u0026rsquo;s, meaning that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel that cold.\nHostels Argentina is ok It\u0026rsquo;s difficult to find hostels in Puerto Natales, Chile I found one room in a house, with a broken window, my phone froze\nHotels are expensive Airbns were not common (And expensive too) Restaurants were not that better, many were closed down, but grocery stores were open\nCooking is a valid solution Camping is not.\nTransportation Only one or two buses a day run from Punta Arenas to Puerto Natales, they are slow and departs a bit late in the morning. They take about 3–4 hours and often leave late\nTranscountry buses run from Puerto Natales (once a day), going to El calafate, through El Turbio\u0026rsquo;s border.\nThey are easily full, do book in advance if possible. I asked my place for help\nEverything takes quite a bit of time, allow yourself enough travel days.\nMy ratio travel/transport wasn\u0026rsquo;t the best. With more days, I would have moved less and hiked more, like El Chalten\nIn Chile, check Bus Sur or Buses Fernández. In Argentina, look for Marga Taqsa, Cal Tur, or Taqsa Patagonia. El Chaltén can be reached from El Calafate even in winter, but buses are limited — usually every two or three days. I booked a tour\nThe border crossings are fine but slow down considerably the trips, count one to two hours to cross a border. Between Chile and Argentina, I had to wait one hour for someone to come to scan the passports.\nPro tip: Always confirm return times directly at the terminal. Online info is outdated half the time.\nActivities Hiking Torres del Paine is doable, without any special gear, as a day hike.\nSee the snow!\nTorres del paine is wonderful The Perito moreno is at its best El Chalten might be hard to see, but hiking is possible Many tours, mostly by cars wit small groups run around, shop in town All the museums should be open No penguins near Punta Arenas Antarctica is off limit in winter And that\u0026rsquo;s it!\nBring warm clothes, plan ahead for hotels and transportation\nComments?

I do a load of laundry every week. One warmer layer (hoodie, fleece, whatever) for nights or higher altitudes. Underwear and socks can get dirty fast, bring enough to rotate. Shoes: one solid pair for walking, eventually flip flops or something similar. Try having similar colors, it\u0026rsquo;s easier for washing machines (unless you want a pink shirt) Sunglasses / Cap Note: Everybody wear the same clothes a couple time, if you don\u0026rsquo;t sweat too much, use a t-shirt for two days. If you can\u0026rsquo;t wash a cloth right away, air dry it so it remains \u0026lsquo;fresh\u0026rsquo;, then pack it aside your other clothes. Drink enough water, you don\u0026rsquo;t want to have sweat touching your clothes, otherwise they will smell. Showers twice a day if possible, it also help maintaining clean clothes.\nSleep \u0026amp; Comfort Sleeping mask: lifesaver in planes and buses, useful in busy hostels, doesn\u0026rsquo;t take any space. Earplugs: obvious, unless your are Hearing Impaired like me, you might need them. Lightweight towel: Dries fast and doesn’t take too much space. Useful as a spare. Health \u0026amp; Hygiene Wet wipes: Replace TP or showers when camping. Antibacterial gel: use it often, especially before eating. If going to India, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to resupply along the way. Bandaids and sterile compresses: I seldom use them for myself, but I saved a few with them. Diarrhea medication: Looking for your usual medication in a foreign country isn\u0026rsquo;t fun, don\u0026rsquo;t let that ruin your trip. Dry soap and shampoo: small, doesn’t leak, often ecological. Toothbrush and toothpaste: Don\u0026rsquo;t be that guy. File/Nail trimmer. Electronics USB cables, at least two, just in case. Power bank: for those long journeys when your phone dies at 12%. Adapter: You can find universal blocks online, some even charge multiple devices at once. Reader: A Kindle or a Kobo are nice things to have, lighter than books and they last a while Earphones: Don\u0026rsquo;t be that guy. Other A sewing kit. A pen. Bloody useful for customs forms and border crossings. Foldable hiking poles: Ok, that take some space, but as I\u0026rsquo;m getting older, I\u0026rsquo;m becoming more fragile while going down slopes. It\u0026rsquo;s also useful when hiking above 5000 meters. Sun screen. The Rule If you’re hesitating about packing something: don’t.\nYou can buy almost anything on the road, usually cheaper than at home.\nPack light, keep it simple, and remember that every extra kilo feels like ten after a week.\nComments?

Amidst those big cities, patches of rewarding nature! I went for around a week back in April 2025, mainly to eat as much as possible (My love for dumplings will last till I die) and see Hong Kong, one of Asia\u0026rsquo;s most interesting city; In the end, I had a memorable trip!\nBefore diving into my itinerary, a few considerations:\nIt\u0026rsquo;s fine to start in any of the major airport, you can either do a \u0026rsquo;line\u0026rsquo; or a loop. For a line, the best starting and ending points are Hong Kong and Guangzhou Hong Kong is not really China, the one country two systems policy still remains, hence Hong Kong has its own visa policy and rules. To survive in mainland China, Alipay and a translator apps are lifesavers. Cash is accepted, but annoying to use and find. AMAP is now in english, even on Android, it works very well in mainland China. Google Maps is better in HK Never speak abour politics. It\u0026rsquo;s touchy. I did it in 7 days, but 8 would have been better. Damn flight deals. I did a loop itinerary from/to Shenzhen as the flights were less than 100$ both ways from Phnom Penh, so I\u0026rsquo;ll keep that order, adapt to your situation ;)\nDay 1: Arrival in Shenzhen - Baoan If you arrive in Shenzhen, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure you land in Bao\u0026rsquo;an. So what\u0026rsquo;s the best place to visit on a first day?\nBao\u0026rsquo;An of course!\nI wanted to keep Shenzhen last as I arrived very early, so I actually skipped to Hong Kong by bus straight from the airport. To do that, I went to the tourist counter, they explained everything and sold me a transfer bus that left around 5AM to the island of Hong Kong. It\u0026rsquo;s super convenient! However I was super tired, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t as enjoyable to visit with half a decent night, hence I recommend spending an afternoon in Shenzhen before moving on to HK the next morning.\nMorning? A few kilometers from the airport, you have the Happy Harbour, a touristic area undergoing heavy development and a nice way to see Shenzhen. (You can also find the place under the name Baoan Binhai Cultural Park)\nThat\u0026rsquo;s also where you find the famous library, it\u0026rsquo;s in the commercial center, right in the middle.\nI suggest spending your morning/afternoon there, get some food, explore the Xiaomi shop, see the sculptures, see the sea and Shenzhen impressive skyline\u0026hellip; It\u0026rsquo;s a bit mid, but good as a first visit.\nYou can easily use two hours to see all, count three if you eat.\nAfternoon You have more time? Spend the rest of the day in Nantou\u0026rsquo;s old city to get this Old City Feel! The old cities of Nantou and Xin\u0026rsquo;An as well as a nice park, Zhongshan Park are right next to each other.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t have time, it\u0026rsquo;s ok. You can leave this for later if you return to Shenzhen.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easy to spend two to three hours seeing everything.\nDay 2: Hong Kong - North (Mong kok, TST \u0026amp; more) The bus from Shenzhen will drop you around Mong Kok, if you come from the airport, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to reach. It\u0026rsquo;s also an area wth plenty of accomodation.\nFret not if you\u0026rsquo;re further, the YHA is in Sham Shui Po, an easy trip by subway. If you\u0026rsquo;re poor like me, then it\u0026rsquo;s nice to be out of the center.\nMorning It\u0026rsquo;s time to walk!\nStart from the Wong Tai Sin Temple (metro by the same name), visit it and then make your way to the remnants of the densest neighborhood that used to be: Kowloon. Walk further to see the Nan Lian gardens and the Chi Lin nunnery and even further to hike a mountain! The viewpoints are many and so are the sights, eating opportunities and other cool stuff.\nIf you walked well, congrats, it\u0026rsquo;s now the (late) afternoon.\n(Late) Afternoon Lets go to Tsim Sha Tsui!\nSouth of this part of HK, you have another nice cluster: Nice buildings, the avenue of stars, the Bruce Lee statue and the harbor. There are plenty of museums as well, if that\u0026rsquo;s your thing. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty much bored out of them, so I visit sparingly.\nOnce night falls, be sure to see the drone show. If it\u0026rsquo;s not too late, or if you\u0026rsquo;re not tired yet, see Temple Street on the way back for a rewarding night market experience.\nDay 3: Hong Kong - Lantau Morning Let\u0026rsquo;s go get some greenery! To get to Lantau, the easiest way is to take the subway to Tung Chung. To get started for this day activity, you need to follow with a bus to Tian Tan Buddha. Those buses are near the man road, a bit north of the station, follow the tourists. This is the cheapest way to see the giant buddha and to start hiking Lantau Peak (934m according to Google), Lantau Peak is a good way to see the whole island.\nHence:\nI recommend walking around the Big Buddha, walk up the stairs, see the Po Lin Monastery then head out toward the hiking path; walking past the Wisdom path and its pillars, toward the hill and viewpoint over the island. Be prepared to walk quite a lot, with a terrain that is not that easy, I rolled my ankle on the way down, the next five days weren\u0026rsquo;t so fun. The picture for this section has been taken from the top.\nAfternoon From Ngong Ping Village (near the Buddha), there is a cable car station and a bus station. Early in the afternoon, there are buses every 30 minutes going to the Tai\u0026rsquo;O fishing village. That\u0026rsquo;s the destination.\nAccording to GMaps, bus number 21 is the only direct one, if you want to go down using the cable car, then you can use buses 1 and 11, it\u0026rsquo;s a 20 minutes drive.\nWalk around the market, spot the cats and eat delicious mochis! AThere is a promenade near the sea, a few nice shops (inexpensive compared to the rest of the country) and a marker. After that visit, it\u0026rsquo;ll probably be late, head back to Tung Chung by bus (Bus number 11) and zip back to mainland HK by subway (Orange line).\nFrom Tai\u0026rsquo;O, it\u0026rsquo;s easily two hours to get back to the center of Hong Kong\u0026hellip; Be prepared to be dead tired.\nDay 4: Hong Kong - Central Morning Now let\u0026rsquo;s explore the last important island of Hong Kong: Hong Kong Island (of course). The beautiful skyscrappers of the coastline, the monster building in Causeway Bay, the batteries and forts\u0026hellip; Just by going east along the coast, you have sights after sights. (I recommend taking the bus, it\u0026rsquo;s quite spread out, use and abuse it) If you like uncommon sights, you can go a bit further out and check out the Haw Par mansion or the Hong Kong movie archives (I haven\u0026rsquo;t been inside but the building is cool) Once I visited all of that I went to get some eggtarts from Bakehouse in Central (And to grab some lunch on the go)\nAfternoon If you too went to Bakehouse in Central, then you are near one of the main touristic area, the Central-Mid levels escalors and the main parts of Central. Enjoy the street art, the cool building and the escalator letting you go all the way to the base of Mount Victoria. And then\u0026hellip; It\u0026rsquo;s hiking time again.\nGo up the mountain for a good sunset/night view of the city! If you went up Lantau the previous day, without hurting youreslf like I did, then it should be fine. Even with one limping leg, I did it easily.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it for Hong Kong. If you have more time, then you can head to more museums, go shopping, see different viewpoints, see a horse race near Wan Chai, perhaps even go to Lamma Island\u0026hellip; If I were to be stranded one month in HK, I legit would never be bored!\nDay 5: Macau Morning Both Ferries and buses goes to Macau, I think I went with One Bus, but I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure, it\u0026rsquo;s been a while. There are two islands, drop your bags to your hotel in the right island!\nI started with Coloane, the southern island. Check out the casinos, the tram and, if by chance you have enough time, the Coloane village! I think it\u0026rsquo;s ok to visit until 3PM or something. Take your time. I didn\u0026rsquo;t visit Coloane Village, and I kinda regret, another traveler showed me pictures and it was hella cute. Instead I spent more time in the northern island and ended up rushing it a bit (Same as with Guangzhou)\nAfternoon Let\u0026rsquo;s go to the northern island. Start from A-Ma temple (at the tram\u0026rsquo;s terminus) and walk toward the center It\u0026rsquo;s as easy as that. On the way you have the Casa do Mandarim, a lot of portuguese churches, the Dom Pedro V theater, pastries\u0026hellip;\nThen, it\u0026rsquo;s time to see the Largo Do Senado, the Sao Paulo ruins and the Monte do Forte. That\u0026rsquo;s a lot!\nOnce night befell the skies, I headed east toward the casinos (such as the Lisboa, to get another night view. If you have more time, lucky you! Be sure to head to the Guia lighthouse while you have time (And see the San Lazaro district on the way)\nDon\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to add a day to spread it out, I walked more than 20 kilometers that day.\nDay 6: Guangzhou Morning Let\u0026rsquo;s go to Guangzhou.\nAnd take the train this time. Head north with a bus to Portas do Cerco (They also go round the island, ask around and see!), that\u0026rsquo;s the border. From there, after the crossing you get to a train station where you can use your remaining patacas before heading to Guangzhou.\nOnce in town, I recommend walk toward Yuexiu park starting form the Temple of Six Banyan Trees. From the temple go north to the Dr Sun Wat-Sen\u0026rsquo;s Memorial Hall then the Nanyue King Wen\u0026rsquo;s mausoleum.\nEat an early lunch before going to see the rest, otherwise you\u0026rsquo;re going to have a very late lunch.\nAfternoon Right after the mausoleum stands the big park hosting the famous ram statue and the Guangzhou museum an old building/viewpoint that is a cheap museum teaching about the city\u0026rsquo;s history and fights with pirates. Interesting and good for pictures! Before the dark replace the blue, use the metro to zap to the English district in Shamian. You can have a leisurely walk near colonial buildings, close to the river. In the late afternoon it\u0026rsquo;s busy in a good way. It does\u0026rsquo;t take too much time and allow you to see another side of the city.\nAfterwards, it should be around nightfall, head to the center to see the light show near the Guangzhou TV Tower, iirc it\u0026rsquo;s the Huacheng Plaza, the small island and then the new tower is across. An underground shuttle allow you to freely cross tehe river without worries, but there are a few bridges as well.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to use Didi to get to those places easily. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to find your way in the subway or to use the buses. I took more time than wanted to see the city because I walked too much and had too hard of a time finding my way. Hopefully, by now there are better transportation apps in english (AMAP was still in chinese only when I went\u0026hellip;)\nDay 7: Last day - Guangzhou/Shenzen Morning Use remaining time to finish the visit in Guangzou, I recommend to see the Shen Clan Ancestral Hall, but be sure to book in advance (online only) then head to the station and zip to Shenzhen. If you have time, the two parks neaer the Hall are both equally green and beautiful, it\u0026rsquo;s nice to take a break from the big city.\nAfternoon We are getting to the end of this article and i\u0026rsquo;m gtting Lazy. So refer to day 1 of Shenzhen and finish any unfinished business. Shopping, old town, the harbour, a hike\u0026hellip; There are many possibilities, but Shenzhen ain\u0026rsquo;t exactly a touristic city.\nDay X: With more days, ideas Too much time on your hands? Add a day for the casinos in Macau or spend one more night in Guangzhou to have more leisure!\nYou can also add a day in HK to hike, it\u0026rsquo;s a hiking paradise after all :)\nComments?

It sums up the tools and tricks that actually make a difference when moving around the country.\n(No shame: I used ChatGPT for quick formatting and some of the content)\nThere are no affiliations in this post, sadly. If any of the company mentioned here wishes to give me money, please do.\nEssential Apps \u0026amp; Tools AMAP It\u0026rsquo;s available in English, even on Android now (yay). Works much better than Google Maps in mainland China. Rather accurate for walking, buses, and metro. Stations are detailed down to exits and entrances. It\u0026rsquo;s wonky at times and there are untranslated parts. Google Translate /!\\ Download the Chinese language before arriving. The camera function is useful for menus and signs (It understandmy english better than my french!?). Conversation mode works decently for simple interactions, but I prefer to use the one in Alipay. VPNs Most of our sites (Google, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube…) are blocked. Install a VPN before entering China. LetsVPN and Astrill are common choices (I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get Windscribe or Google\u0026rsquo;s VPN to work). Some work better than others depending on the region, so it\u0026rsquo;s worth having a backup. If you have a foreign sim card with data in China, then there\u0026rsquo;s probably no need for a VPN. My French SIM Card with Free Mobile has 30 GB of data in China and let me use Whatsapp, Reddit and more without a VPN But the downside is that, with this one, I don\u0026rsquo;t have internet in France. Since I switched to a better provider, I had to say goodbye to those benefits\nTransportation Booking Trains Trains are the easiest way to move around (And are often cheap). Trip.com offers English booking, accepts foreign cards, and often has competitive prices. You\u0026rsquo;ll receive a QR code or pick-up code. A passport is required for every booking and at the station (They check\u0026hellip;). Using Didi Equivalent of Uber, but cheap. The app has an English interface and can be use through Alipay. Payment works with foreign cards or through Alipay. Payments Alipay QR code payments, anytime, anywhere. Non chinese citizen can link their bank card on it (needs a passport). If linking fails, apparently, there is a “Tour Pass” option you can top up. I never tried. WeChat Requires a stupid verification using chinese friend. You can get banned anytime for no reason. It\u0026rsquo;s a shitty app, I hate it. Payment with foreign cards is unreliable, but it\u0026rsquo;s still useful for messaging. I use Rednote for messaging now, it\u0026rsquo;s fine. Other Notes Cash: Be prepared to receive weird looks. I usually avoid paying by cash Trains vs flights: For distances under 1,000 km, trains are faster overall. Toilets: Widespread but basic; carry tissues and sanitizer. Etiquette: Avoid politics, queue firmly, stay polite and calm at all time, Thai style: Don\u0026rsquo;t lose face. Don\u0026rsquo;t speak about you-know-what. Don\u0026rsquo;t. Never carry a lighter, don\u0026rsquo;t take pictures of flags, military installations or anything that could be sensitive Photos: Some government employees can ask to check your phone, some flags and previous leaders of long-gone countries (And an empire) are forbidden. People taking pictures: Chinese love to take pictures of foreigners. I don\u0026rsquo;t wanna know what they do with them\u0026hellip; Insert Larry.webp Comments?

Really.\nOnce you have it, you can apply for the visa itself. Prices vary a bit depending on your nationality, but expect around 55–85 USD for the visa fee, plus an additional 14 USD entry tax at the border.\nAs of September 2025, there is still a requirement for a COVID test at the border. Not only it\u0026rsquo;s fake, but it\u0026rsquo;s also 35 USD for the privilege.\nIn total, I gave 100$ with a crisp bill.\nThe Agency There are plenty of agencies out there, but I can personally recommend the one and only Ruslan Hydyrov from IndieGuide. He was reliable, quick to answer emails, and knows the system inside out. *\nContact:\nPhone: +993 61 67 22 66 Mail: ruslanhydyrov@gmail.com If you get in touch, tell him you come thanks to Tim Paris (that\u0026rsquo;s me). He\u0026rsquo;ll know.\nThe Border At the moment (September 2025), the only open land border for tourists is near Dashoguz, the Shavat crossing from Uzbekistan.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re coming overland, you\u0026rsquo;ll likely cross from Khiva (Uzbekistan) into Turkmenistan.\nI took a Yandex shared with another traveler and found one in twenty minutes. It\u0026rsquo;s an hour drive, be prepared for a long wait and to have to give a bonus to your driver. I gave the equivalent of a very good meal as a bonus.\nFlights Flying in or out is possible, you have to book a flight through the official Turkmenistan Airlines website https://turkmenistanairlinestr.com/tr-TR\nFrom Ashgabat, there are direct flights to Istanbul, Milano, London and Frankfurt. Prices are low for Central Asia.\nTo go to Milano, I paid around 220€, a steal!\nSafety \u0026amp; Rules Turkmenistan has a reputation for being strict, but in reality it\u0026rsquo;s not as scary as you think.\nWalking at night in Ashgabat is totally fine. I did it without issues or hassle, despite me not having a guide. Safety is basically guaranteed: There are no crimes. Beards and long hair are fine, despite rumors of them being illegal. There is quite a lot of freedom, but avoid taking pictures of the military and other sensitive stuff. Internet is 99% blocked, you need a good VPN or to forget about using the internet. ATMs / Cost / Gifts There are no ATMs in the country, bring enough cash. Online transfers are painful, getting USD at the border or in Uzbekistan is hard, paying by visa is a no as well. BRING CASH.\nIt costs a lot. Tours are private, so the more you are, the cheaper it is. Expect to pay up to 200 USD a day.\nFor gifts: The dried apricots are to die for. I brought like half a kilo of them, I should have brought two.\nFinal Notes Turkmenistan is not an easy country to enter, but once inside, it\u0026rsquo;s a fascinating place.\nThe bureaucracy and fees are part of the package. If you prepare your documents, book through a good agency, and accept that things move at their own pace, you\u0026rsquo;ll be rewarded with one of the most unique trips you can have in Central Asia.\nBy the way here\u0026rsquo;s my itinerary: With the tour I did\nComments?

I started from Uzbekitan. The logical road used to be UZ-TM-IR nowadays, it\u0026rsquo;s only possible to go from UZ to TM. So I went to the Shavat border in Uzbekistan, taking a shared taxi from Khiva One hour later I was at the border, filled with Turkmen coming home with their shopping (TVs, PS4, computer stuff, air fryers\u0026hellip;).\nAfter a very long and stupid trip (you have to pay a bus to cross 200m through the No man\u0026rsquo;s land), I reached the Turkmen outpost, met my guide, Ruslan there. Here are his info:\nContact:\nPhone: +993 61 67 22 66 Mail: ruslanhydyrov@gmail.com If you get in touch, tell him you come thanks to Tim Paris (that\u0026rsquo;s me). He\u0026rsquo;ll know.\n(He\u0026rsquo;s aware I\u0026rsquo;m putting his contact info here, I asked for permission. I\u0026rsquo;m not gaining anything from this)\nAfter paying the necessary 100$ or something for the visa, entry and covid test, I was in!\nThe price is not the same for everyone, check with your guide and our nationality Also, carry a lot of cash with fresh USD notes, it\u0026rsquo;s mandatory\nSo, yeah, I got in the country, my guide met me at the border, we got a driver and went all the way to Konye Urgench to see the ruins. Felt a bit meh compared to Uzbekistan, much more ruined and spread out. It\u0026rsquo;s still nice for history buffs, especially when doing a guided tour, thing I didn\u0026rsquo;t do back in UZ.\nAfter Konye, we went to Darva- not. Back to the border town of Dashoguz. Yup, the road to Darvaza is not finished from Konye, so enjoy the long detour.\nFinally, after a bumpy road that was dreadful, I arrived at Darvaza, the gates of Hell!\nWe visited at night to see the beautiful flames and the stars.\nSee the pictures:\nNice isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\nDay 2 Darvaza This is a bit mixed with the previous day, sorry.\n(After a barbecue and some wildlife spotting, I slept in a Yurt near the crater until sunrise. The Darvaza crater during the day is quite a worrying sight, dying out and not much to boast. The gates to Hell are soon to be just a hole in the desert.\nAnyaway, we continued, seeing other craters on the way as well as the sand dunes, through the bumpy road. To where? Ashgabat of course.\nA city of white marble, of elegance, of rules (And of a ruler), dazzling in the desert. Ashgabat is only missing Aladdin and his flying carpet to be complete.\nI thoroughly enjoyed the visit, mostly by car, to the grand buildings and all the center of interests. Everything is so spread apart and most of the touristic attractions are actually outside of the lively city. It\u0026rsquo;s not a ghost town, just that most things you see on the internet are located near government buildings and near a soon-to-be forest.\nAt night, the city is also quite lively, I walked freely, met some people, spoke with soldiers, shook I don\u0026rsquo;t know how many hands, said hi to everyone and well\u0026hellip; just enjoyed the city by myself\nDay 3 Ashgabat Depending on you tour, you may have more time to have an in depth visit of Ashgabat. I think it\u0026rsquo;s worth it. The mosque is beautiful and the acoustic is incredible, it\u0026rsquo;s nice to see the busy train station, the roundabouts deserve their own tour, the indoor ferris wheel is stupid, the marriage center might be where you will find a bride, the station, a bribe\u0026hellip; The commercial centers are nice for shopping too, shop for the dried apricots, they are lovely (Best I had so far).\nOn your way out, admire the airport built like a bird and enjoy the cheap, fixed rate, flights to europe and more. I went Ashgabat-Milano as Paris is not deserved since covid, it was inexpensive for the quality, the only downside was the 100€ bus to go back home.

The sea breeze makes the promenade near the cliffs pleasant, and locals are out running, cycling, and fishing.\nA striking Soviet influence is visible in large avenues, dilapidated buildings, and dust everywhere. Without oil, Aktau would not have grown into the city it is today.\nThe morning is ideal for exploring the coast. Take a walk along the Skalnaya Tropa Promenade, a 1.5km scenic path along the cliffs, perfect for morning photos. Spot the Melovoy Lighthouse, built atop a residential building, and visit city landmarks like the Ship Statue and the monument to Ukrainian writer Taras Shevchenko.\nAktau serves as the gateway to the Mangystau region. Use the afternoon to book a tour to Mangystau. I personnaly used RedMaya Travel. If you have more time in the city, do visit the mosque, the memorial and spot the countless soviet murals on the walls.\nDay 2 Torysh \u0026amp; Sherkala Early departure with a small group leads out of Aktau. The back city reveals former gulag-style apartments and silent oil wells. Beyond the industrial edge, the steppe suddenly bursts into life.\nCamels, dromedaries, horses, and goats roam freely across the surprisingly green steppe. Summer rains have transformed the desert into fertile grazing land.\nThe first stop is Torysh – Valley of the Balls, filled with spherical rocks covered in marine fossils. Scientists remain puzzled by their origin. After a short break for lunch at a small roadside restaurant, the 4x4 drives further into the steppes.\nNext, climb Kolkala, the Blue Mountain, for its colorful strata and quartz formations. Nearby is Sherkala – Tiger Mountain, a large isolated rock with hidden tunnels once used as a fort and lookout. The day ends at Airakty Shomanai, where rocky “castles” surround the camp. Sunset and sunrise here are breathtaking, under the stars of the Tengri sky.\nDay 3 Bozjyra Plateau An early start involves packing tents and heading out for a long drive, passing desert villages and an oil town. The Ustyurt Plateau eventually opens into Bozjyra, a white, rocky plain with isolated cones, towers, and fang-like formations rising from the steppe.\nFew animals are seen beyond marmots and traces of goats. Rain and wind later force a move to a more sheltered roadside camp.\nThis one was my favourite day of the trip, Bozjyra is truly grand.\nDay 4 Tiramisu Canyon \u0026amp; Boktu The morning brings clear skies and scorching heat. Visit Tiramisu Canyon, with creamy white walls cut by brown striations and abundant fossils. The canyon is unique and photogenic.\nA detour to Boktu Mountain underlines the desert’s extreme heat. Optical illusions and mirages make the landscape seem otherworldly. Return to Aktau late in the day, exhausted and ready for showers.\nDay 5-6 Astana I took an early morning flight to Astana. The train would have been far too long (close to 24h!)\nThis city is modern, green, and beautifully planned, a stark contrast to Aktau.\nOver two days, walk the city, explore parks, squares, and monuments such as Baiterek, Hazrat Sultan Mosque, the Palace of Peace and Reconciliation, and Khan Shatyr, as well at the brand new mosque, at the edge of the city. It is the bigget mosque of Central Asia, but it strangely devoid of believers.\nConstruction is ongoing for metro lines and other infrastructure, hopefully it will open soon.\nThe capital is sunny and open, requiring sunscreen and patience for long pedestrian detours.\nDay 7 Aqmola \u0026amp; Alzhir Morning trip north from Astana to Aqmola.\nI used Yandex to find the needed bus and made my way to Aqmola, it took around one hour.\nVisit Alzhir, the gulag for wives and children of political prisoners under Stalin. The memorial is striking but leaves a sense of absence; exhibits are sparse compared to expectations. Walking the grounds, the scale and solitude of the site make the oppression feel palpable.\nReturn to Astana in the afternoon and prepare for a night train to Almaty. Those trains are comfortable and the trip will ends in no time, even though it lasts 17 hours.\nDay 8 Almaty City Arrival in Almatyn an historical city that did not preserve its history.\nVisit the Green Bazaar for local foods and snacks, Panfilov Park and Zenkov Cathedral, a colorful wooden building, close to an older traditional building (the musicial instrument museum, I believe). If you have time, take the cable car to Kok Tobe for city views. Museums like the Central State Museum offer historical context, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t been there, someone told me it was more or less the same than the one in Astana.\nThe city feels like Grenoble (The french chicago) without delinquency, with parks as calm oases amid Soviet urbanism.\nIT\u0026rsquo;s a really nice city to spend some time in and to base yourself for hikes.\nDay 9 Big Almaty Lake I went to hike to Big Almaty Lake with a friend, starting a bit late due to delays. he route follows a paved road, then water pipes requiring ropes. Military restrictions make the lake hard to access; it appears nearly empty, a contrast to iconic photos. So it was utterly disappointing.\nI inclded it here because in the end it\u0026rsquo;s my itinerary, but, it\u0026rsquo;s much better to skip it and add one more day from the trip to Charyn and Kolsai.\nContoversely, at sunset, the scenery is spectacular, at least ansd at last, a good thing.\nDay 10 Canyons and Lakes Book one of the numerous tour to get out of the city, especially one for Kolsai, Kaindy and the charyn canyon.\nTwo days is better than one, I did it in one, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t great. Everything was rushed and my group was super slow.\nThe first step is Lake Kolsai, abeautiful lake born from an earthquake, amidst a pine forest.\nNext is Lake Kaindy, where a flooded forest presents a surreal scene. Dead tree trunks rise vertically from the water, preserved after a historical landslide. Walking along the shore allows full appreciation of its haunting beauty.\nFinally, explore Charyn Canyon (Valley of Castles). Dramatic red cliffs, jagged formations, and visible wildlife make this a mesmerizing landscape.\nDay 11 Shymbulak Ski resort A ski resort?? Yu^p, it\u0026rsquo;s also a place to hike.\nHike above 3000 meters in the Tian Shan, near the Shymbulak ski resort.\nThe 1000-meter climb passes green alpine meadows to glaciers and snow. The hike is rocky, slippery, and slow, though a cable car from the base helps. Scenery is breathtaking, and locals are friendly, offering water and support along the route. Descent is tiring and even more slippery.\nI\u0026rsquo;d recommend the cable car on the way down, but be careful, it gets crowded. And it\u0026rsquo;s stupidly expensive too.\nDay 12 Toward Bishkek From the Almaty central bus station, take one of the numerous bus to Bishkek. They leave every two hours or something similar.\nThe bus ride covers 200 km in ~5 hours due to the border crossing.\nEvening is reserved for rest and recovery.\nFor travelers heading further to Karakol, buses run via Bishkek and around Lake Issyk Kul, a long but scenic route.\nKyrgyztan Day 13 Bishkek A simple day: Do a walk in the tiny city center, still under construction in parts.\nBishkek is flat, wide, and rather uninspiring. Tourists mostly come for the State History Museum, excellent for Soviet and nomadic history, and the new mosque, a Turkish-built replica inspired by Hagia Sophia.\nThe hostel I went in Apple Hostel Bishkek, in contrast to the city, was alive with travelers: young hikers, solo backpackers, and small groups exchanging stories and planning routes. The evening was spent chatting, meeting new people, and swapping travel tips.\nDay 14 Ala-Archa National Park Early morning departure to Ala-Archa National Park, just south of Bishkek.\nA half-day hike follows trails through pine forests and steep valleys. Streams and small waterfalls punctuate the path, while jagged peaks rise suddenly from the valley floor.\nAla-Archa is perfect for a mountain experience: accessible, yet offering a sense of remoteness. Trails are well-marked, but slippery rocks and mountain streams require attention. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to reach, there is a bus going straight to the trailhead, I found it on Yandex. Most hostels know the bus and where to take it.\nDay 15-17 Song-Kul Three days spent at Song-Kul, combining horse trekking and yurt stays.\nDeparture early morning from Bishkek, traversing valleys and mountain passes to reach Kyzart village. After lunch, each traveler receives a horse, with bags attached. The horses are independent and guide the ride across valleys, rivers, and ridges, experiencing drastic temperature drops from 30°C to 10°C.\nNights are spent in shared yurts, cold but charming. Over the following days, the trek alternates between steep mountain climbs and open plains for galloping. Horses move with grace through herds of horses and cattle, fully immersing travelers in steppe life.\nOn the final day, descend toward a lush village valley, Song-Kul fading behind. Afternoon transfer with six other travelers heads toward Karakol, saving time despite the long journey. Arrival is late evening.\nIt was my first multi days hike on a horse, it was truly something. I hate horses, but someone roped me into going, so I spent three days on a fart machine that did whatever he wanted. Great!\nDay 18 Karakol Karakol sits between Lake Issyk-Kul and the Tien Shan mountains, population around 100,000, swelling in summer with tourists.\nStroll the lively streets, cafés full of Russian and European visitors, and nearby small beaches on the lake. Local architecture is diverse: Russian-style “gingerbread” houses, a Tatar mosque, a Dungan mosque, and Dungan-Chinese restaurants. The bazaar is built from shipping containers.\nI went there straight after Song-Kul, using a shared taxi from Kyzart, it took around 7 hours due to road constructions.\nit\u0026rsquo;s the most beautiful city of Kyrgyztan, probably because it\u0026rsquo;s a russian/dungan city. I really aprpeciated the abundance of Dungan food.\nDay 19 Jeti-Ögüz Morning visit to the famous Sunday animal market, the largest in Central Asia. Livestock includes cows, horses, and sheep.\n(Do it when it\u0026rsquo;s a sunday, if it\u0026rsquo;s not, spend more time around Jeti Ogyuz, there are nice hikes in the area)\nMid-morning minibus takes the group to Jeti-Ögüz, with a shared taxi for the final stretch (~1.50€). The hike features red rock cliffs and alpine valleys. The trail to the viewpoint is less exciting, but scenery remains beautiful.\nAsk for Jeti Oguz Kogort (Resort), only a handful of buses go there, and not year round, seemingly not everyday either.\nReturn to Karakol involves hitchhiking due to missing minibus service. Arrival around 17:00.\nDay 20 Altyn Arashan Early departure via minibus from Karakol bazaar to trailhead. The first hour is muddy and under construction, with essential old water pipelines visible.\nBegin an 8-hour alpine hike with a companion. Dense pine forests, gray river valleys, and horses grazing accompany the path. Russian jeeps ferry non-hikers (~20€ each). Arrival at the yurt camp occurs in rain, with the valley more touristy than online photos suggest. The return hike can be done by hitching after the last minibus. A long, wet, and tiring day. But so worth it!! When you look up pictures of Kyrgyztan online, you\u0026rsquo;ll often see the Altyn Arashan valley. Now it\u0026rsquo;s crowded with camps, yurts, tourists and booming infrasture, but you can still find nice spots, especially going further.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re lazy, you can use a car to go up or down. They ask for 40€ or something similar.\nDay 21 Trip to Osh Transport day covers ~400 km to Osh, split into a 6-hour minibus and 12-hour overnight cargo bus through mountains. Summer heat and constant horn honking make it exhausting. Arrival is the next morning.\nImportant notes There is no real night bus to Osh. At least not in 2025. Go to the market and find a Cargo Bus\nIt\u0026rsquo;s at the \u0026ldquo;Kerben section\u0026rdquo; of the Dordoi market says people online. I haven\u0026rsquo;t found ths Kerben thing, but I went where cargo bus were loaded and found one leaving to Osh, I was allowed to seat behind the drivers. The whole night was seated with a family of four across a single row. Ouch. It was around 20€ for the privilege.\nDay 22 Osh \u0026amp; Pamir Highway Start Osh, the second city of Kyrgyzstan, is more Uzbek in character but surprisingly modern. Streets feature bubble tea, ice cream, pizza, and bars. Sacred mountain is unimpressive; the city is partially under reconstruction.\nDont waste time there it\u0026rsquo;s essentially just a starting point to the Pamir Highway or to Peak Lenin.\nPrepare for the Pamir Highway, a 7-day jeep journey through Gorno-Badakhshan toward Dushanbe. Afternoon briefing, then departure through arid mountains separating Fergana Valley from Alay Valley.\nDay 23-24 Peak Lenin / Pamir Highlights Journey climbs to 3,500 meters, passing villages and rivers with red mountains in view.\nStop at Lake Tulpir Kul, overnight in yurts. Peak Lenin viewpoints reveal snow-capped peaks (~7,000m) and glaciers.\nWith my group we spent one evening and a morning there, we did a small hike and enjoyed the red and green mountains as well as the multi colored lakes. Honestly, one of Kyrgyztan\u0026rsquo;s prettiest area.\nTadjikistan Day 25 Karakul Lake After a morning drive from Peak Lenin, we reached the border then went on to Karakul Lake, altitude ~3,600 meters.\nThe lake sits in a high-altitude desert, surrounded by jagged peaks and minimal vegetation. The water is clear blue and mirrors the mountains, creating a dramatic backdrop. Small local encampments are scattered along the shore. The wind can be strong, and temperatures drop rapidly in the late afternoon.\nEvening spent at the motel from THe Shining near the lake. It\u0026rsquo;s cold and barebone. Just like the landscape. Welcome to Tadjikistan.\nDay 26 Murghab Plateau A long day of driving, about 6.5 hours over rough roads.\nThe route passes through abandoned villages and vast desert scenery before reaching Murghab, the main hub. Murghab is a container town, poor but trading with China, with a small, somber market. Beyond Murghab, the road quality deteriorates further, dominated by trucks.\nWe stopped at a small, crystal-clear pond teeming with fish, and continued to Alichur, a village of ~800 inhabitants split between Kyrgyz and Pamiri communities. Locals invited us into an impromptu football game, and we tasted yak milk ice cream and enjoyed a yak steak dinner. The night sky was breathtakingly clear, filled with stars.\nDay 27 Langar \u0026amp; Wakhan Valley Departed Alichur toward Langar, near the Afghan border.\nMidway, we stopped at a high-altitude lake for photos, then hiked about three hours, reaching up to 4,800 meters. Marmots and wildflowers dotted the landscape, and the views across the Panj River into Afghanistan were spectacular. Descending to 3,000 meters, greenery and trees returned. Langar village is forested, with a guesthouse offering hot water and electricity—a rare luxury in this remote area. It\u0026rsquo;s a nice spot to rest and to explore the local culture.\nDay 28 Yamchun Fortress Morning drive to Khorog, with a stop at Yamchun Fortress, XII-century ruins perched above the valley. The fortress once guarded historic Afghan trade routes and offers panoramic views.\nWe visited Bibi Fatima hot springs, mingling with locals in the warm waters (naked lol).\nA light hike along the Panj River provided glimpses of both Afghan and Tajik villages. Arrival in Khorog, Gorno-Badakhshan’s capital (~38,000 inhabitants), was quiet and pleasant, though attractions are limited. The vibe there was bad. A member of anoither group got attacked by a guy with a rock, ended up going to the hospital. My group was followed by a weirdo named Hugo, trying his best to take the girls with him. He followed us everywhere and was always close by, preying.\nDay 29 Kalaikhum Six hours of driving along scenic but under-construction roads.\nThe Panj River provided the most striking views, with occasional stops in tiny villages. Kalaikhum itself is a minimal settlement, offering a chance to observe the Afghan border and wash clothes. The only thing worthwhile to do is resting and watching the afghans from afar. A bit boring.\nDay 30 Dushanbe The final leg of the Pamir Highway brought us to Dushanbe. The drivers pushed hard, stopping briefly at the Afghanistan viewpoint and Hulbuk Fortress (XII century, with a small museum). A short visit to Nurek Reservoir, with its clear waters and island, completed the leg. Arrival in Dushanbe at 16:00 was a relief; internet access and city comforts felt luxurious.\nIn the end, the best part of the trip was the people I have been with. Otherwise, the landscapes are a bit boring for the most part, the vibe is usually weird,\nthe company scammed me a few bucks and robbed me of two days, plus were unable to answer queries\u0026hellip; Its not a must do, just like Vietnam\u0026rsquo;s Ha Giang loop, it\u0026rsquo;s overblown and overrated;\nPerhaps it\u0026rsquo;s better on a motorbike, like many do. I guess it\u0026rsquo;s part of the appeal.\nDay 31 and 32 Panjakent Seven Lakes Morning transfer to Panjakent, near Uzbek border.\nExplore local bazaar, taste regional cuisine. Do a short excursions to Seven Lakes area. See the sunset over archaeological ruins of old Panjakent. It\u0026rsquo;s great if you transfer to Uzbekistan from there. I mostly followed other people here before heading to Khujand.\nIf you desire to skip it, use that time to get one more day in Dushanbe, and perhaps one more day for the Fergana valley or something.\nDay 33 Khujand – Historic City Shared taxi from Panjakent (~4 hours) to Khujand, the second-largest city in Tajikistan.\nKhujand is historic, with ancient ruins, a reconstructed fort, small museum, and mausoleum. City parks, the 24-meter Stalin statue, and modern interpretations of architecture provide points of interest.\nKhujand contrasts sharply with the remote Pamir villages and alpine landscapes, marking the end of the Tajikistan leg of the journey.\nThe city is worth it for its big museum\n(close to the boring Sugd historical museum, from the entrance, go left until you find the small gate heading inside) You\u0026rsquo;ll find a fake village, a building similar to the one in Uzbekistan, with hilarious paintings of the great leader inside as well as a hill overlooking th ecity, (site of cities built by Alexander and Cyrus the greats)\nUzbekistan Day 35 and 36 Tashkent Crossing from Khujand into Uzbekistan takes time beneath the blazing sun. The Tajik side involves long queues and a single building for passport control, while the Uzbek side proves faster but no less chaotic. The final leg to Tashkent feels like a scene from a road movie; crowded marshrutkas, animated drivers, and endless detours through suburban streets before the capital’s skyline finally appears.\nTashkent greets travelers with wide boulevards, fountains, and the scent of freshly cut grass from its manicured parks. Despite its size, the city feels calm and deliberate. The Chorsu Bazaar bursts with color; pyramids of spices, towers of melons, and endless chatter beneath the domed roof. Nearby, Soviet‑era mosaics blend with Islamic architecture, a visual reminder of Uzbekistan’s layered past.\nA ride through the Tashkent Metro, built in the 1970s, reveals marble halls and chandeliers worthy of a museum. Above ground, monumental brutalist buildings line vast avenues leading to the Amir Timur Square and the reconstructed Khast‑Imam complex, where ancient Qurans and blue‑tiled domes contrast the modern skyline. By night, the parks glow with fountains and soft music; a gentle end to the capital’s urban rhythm.\nDay 37 and 38 Samarkand The morning bus from Tashkent reaches Samarkand by early afternoon. Heat shimmers over the city’s turquoise domes, and the Gur‑i Amir Mausoleum rises like a mirage; its golden interior reflecting the ambition of Timur’s empire. A short walk away lies the legendary Registan, three madrassas framing the square with perfect symmetry. At sunset, the tiles flare gold and cobalt, and the evening light‑and‑sound show fills the plaza with theatrical grandeur.\nBeyond the monuments, Bibi Khanym Mosque stands half‑restored yet magnificent, while nearby markets hum with daily life. The following morning is devoted to Ulug Beg Observatory, a tribute to the region’s scientific legacy. The Afrosiyob ruins whisper of ancient Maracanda, their surviving frescoes hinting at forgotten empires. Finally, the Shah‑i Zinda necropolis dazzles with a corridor of blue domes and ornate façades; one of Central Asia’s most striking sights.\nAs daylight fades, travelers often continue toward Bukhara, a long road west through endless fields and distant mountains.\nDay 39 and 40 Bukhara Bukhara reveals itself as a labyrinth of sand‑colored walls, minarets, and quiet courtyards. The Po‑i Kalyan complex dominates the skyline, its great minaret once serving as both landmark and legend. Around it, mosques, madrassas, and caravanserais evoke centuries of Silk Road history. The air carries the scent of samsas baking in clay ovens, mingling with the sound of prayers and merchants calling from shaded stalls.\nMornings are perfect for exploring the Ark Fortress or wandering through narrow lanes where artisans still craft ceramics and jewelry. In the afternoon, the Lyabi Hauz square becomes the city’s living room; locals gather beneath mulberry trees, sipping tea by the reflecting pool. At dusk, Bukhara glows softly, its monuments turning amber under the desert sun, the hum of voices fading into calm.\nDay 41 and 42 Khiva The journey west continues by train through the steppe, leading to the walled oasis of Khiva. The Ichan Kala old town feels almost untouched, a compact maze of alleys, mud‑brick houses, and minarets glowing blue and sand‑gold under the heat. During the Melon Festival, the streets fill with music and parades, locals offering slices of sweet fruit to passing travelers.\nWithin the walls, the Kalta Minor Minaret stands unfinished but striking, wrapped in turquoise tiles. The Kuhna Ark, Tosh Hovli Palace, and countless madrassas preserve the flavor of a desert kingdom. By sunset, Khiva’s rooftops turn copper and rose, and the call to prayer echoes through the silent streets, a moment suspended in time.\nDay 43 \u0026amp; 44 Nukus \u0026amp; Karakalpakstan A long drive north leads to Nukus, gateway to the Karakalpakstan region and the once‑mighty Aral Sea. The Savitsky Museum surprises with avant‑garde Soviet art rescued from censorship, while outside the city the Mizdakhan Necropolis and nearby fortresses rise from the dust like mirages of an ancient world.\nFurther west, the landscape turns lunar a vast plain where ships once floated. The Ship Cemetery near Moynaq tells the story of ecological disaster: rusted hulls stranded in the sand, silent witnesses to a vanished sea. Travelers stand at the cliff edge overlooking the dry seabed, where waves no longer reach. The silence of Karakalpakstan is haunting, a fitting close to the long road across Central Asia.\nTurmenistan Tips on how to travel Turkemnistan The Agency There are plenty of agencies out there, but I can personally recommend the one and only Ruslan Hydyrov from IndieGuide. He was reliable, quick to answer emails, and knows the system inside out.\nContact:\nPhone: +993 61 67 22 66 Mail: ruslanhydyrov@gmail.com If you get in touch, tell him you come thanks to Tim Paris (that\u0026rsquo;s me). He\u0026rsquo;ll know.\nDay 45 Konye First thing first, find your way in the country. I started from Uzbekitan. The logical road used to be UZ-TM-IR nowadays, it\u0026rsquo;s only possible to go from UZ to TM. So I went to the Shavat border in Uzbekistan, taking a shared taxi from Khiva One hour later I was at the border, filled with Turkmen coming home with their shopping (TVs, PS4, computer stuff, air fryers\u0026hellip;).\nAfter a very long and stupid trip (you have to pay a bus to cross 200m through the No man\u0026rsquo;s land), I reached the Turkmen outpost, met my guide, Ruslan there.\nAfter paying the necessary 100$ or something for the visa, entry and covid test, I was in!\nThe price is not the same for everyone, check with your guide and our nationality Also, carry a lot of cash with fresh USD notes, it\u0026rsquo;s mandatory\nSo, yeah, I got in the country, my guide met me at the border, we got a driver and went all the way to Konye Urgench to see the ruins. Felt a bit meh compared to Uzbekistan, much more ruined and spread out. It\u0026rsquo;s still nice for history buffs, especially when doing a guided tour, thing I didn\u0026rsquo;t do back in UZ.\nAfter Konye, we went to Darva- not. Back to the border town of Dashoguz. Yup, the road to Darvaza is not finished from Konye, so enjoy the long detour.\nFinally, after a bumpy road that was dreadful, I arrived at Darvaza, the gates of Hell!\nWe visited at night to see the beautiful flames and the stars.\nSee the pictures:\nNice isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\nDay 46 Darvaza This is a bit mixed with the previous day, sorry.\n(After a barbecue and some wildlife spotting, I slept in a Yurt near the crater until sunrise. The Darvaza crater during the day is quite a worrying sight, dying out and not much to boast. The gates to Hell are soon to be just a hole in the desert.\nAnyaway, we continued, seeing other craters on the way as well as the sand dunes, through the bumpy road. To where? Ashgabat of course.\nA city of white marble, of elegance, of rules (And of a ruler), dazzling in the desert. Ashgabat is only missing Aladdin and his flying carpet to be complete.\nI thoroughly enjoyed the visit, mostly by car, to the grand buildings and all the center of interests. Everything is so spread apart and most of the touristic attractions are actually outside of the lively city. It\u0026rsquo;s not a ghost town, just that most things you see on the internet are located near government buildings and near a soon-to-be forest.\nAt night, the city is also quite lively, I walked freely, met some people, spoke with soldiers, shook I don\u0026rsquo;t know how many hands, said hi to everyone and well\u0026hellip; just enjoyed the city by myself\nDay 47 Ashgabat Depending on you tour, you may have more time to have an in depth visit of Ashgabat. I think it\u0026rsquo;s worth it. The mosque is beautiful and the acoustic is incredible, it\u0026rsquo;s nice to see the busy train station, the roundabouts deserve their own tour, the indoor ferris wheel is stupid, the marriage center might be where you will find a bride, the station, a bribe\u0026hellip; The commercial centers are nice for shopping too, shop for the dried apricots, they are lovely (Best I had so far).\nOn your way out, admire the airport built like a bird and enjoy the cheap, fixed rate, flights to europe and more. I went Ashgabat-Milano as Paris is not deserved since covid, it was inexpensive for the quality, the only downside was the 100€ bus to go back home. One hundred for a bus, sheesh, what a bunch of loonies. Turkmenistan \u0026gt; Italy.\nComments?

It was the cheapest flight to Kazakhstan I could find, by the way.\nHow to Visit Mangystau Independent travel is technically possible, but unless you speak Russian or Kazakh, can drive long hours on bad tracks, and are ready to camp without support, it\u0026rsquo;s far easier to go with a local tour.\nI joined a small group tour with a local tour operator I found online prior to arrival. We were six travelers split into two cars, with a driver each and the addition of a guide. Those three were family, accustomed to work together and had all the necessary camping and cooking guide.\nThe driving time were so looooong and the road so confusing, I defo can\u0026rsquo;t recommend going on your own. And don\u0026rsquo;t even think about public transportation, there are barely any cities, and when there\u0026rsquo;s one (or a village) you are still up to 100km away from something meaningful. Due to this, you cannot do it on a true budget as well, you need money $$! (I used RedMaya Travel btw, so I recommend them!)\nFood \u0026amp; Water Meals were a mix of canteens and camp cooking.\nCanteens: Simple Kazakh cuisine in big portions. Not too bad imho. Camp meals: Far better than I expected!, It was filling and varied (as camp-cooking goes), Extras: Bring snacks along the way, sharing is caring. They even managed to accommodate food allergies, which is nice!\nSights \u0026amp; Walking The main reason you come here: the landscapes.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t spoil every stop, but highlights include Bozjyra Canyon, Torysh (Valley of 𝓑𝓪𝓵𝓵𝓼), underground mosques, and surreal plateaus that stretch to the horizon.\nThree days is enough to see the main sites at a good pace, four days would be overkill, two would be boring. Hence I think three is just right.\nI walked between 7 and 14 km each day, though you could walk less, I just prefer exploring on foot once on-site and so did my group (be careful of the heat, it\u0026rsquo;s painfully hot in July).\nIn the end, the rhythm works: long drives, stops to hike and look around, camping under a sky full of stars.\nGuiding \u0026amp; Driving Our guide was knowledgeable, talkative, and very Kazakh in spirit. He added depth to the journey beyond the sights (Thanks ChatGPT for that nice sentence).\nThe two drivers handled rough roads and sand tracks without issue. Communication was slower with them, as their English was limited, but everything ran smoothly.\nCost Mangystau isn\u0026rsquo;t a budget trip.\nTours are on the expensive side, especially compared to other parts of Kazakhstan.\nThat said, you\u0026rsquo;re paying for two drivers, one guide, proper 4x4 vehicles, fuel, camping gear (tents are usually single-use, one per person), and full logistical support.\nFor three full days, the price made sense, especially since there isn\u0026rsquo;t that much demand yet.\nPractical Notes Best time to go: Spring and autumn. Summers can be brutally hot, winters are cold and windy. Packing: Layers, good shoes for walking on rocks and sand, sunscreen, a hat. Connectivity: Mobile coverage is almost non-existent in the desert. Toilets: Wild camping = wild toilets. Don\u0026rsquo;t expect facilities. Sleep: Be prepared to camp. It\u0026rsquo;ll be windy. Where to Next? Mangystau fits into a wider trip across Kazakhstan or Central Asia. From Aktau, you can continue in several directions:\nAstana: Direct flights from Aktau, usually the fastest way (That\u0026rsquo;s what I did!) Almaty: Flights exist, but if you prefer trains, be ready for a very long journey, ie: over 2,500 km, and 24h, or so I\u0026rsquo;ve heard. Uzbekistan: There are trains south from Aktau toward Beyneu, where you can connect onwards to Nukus (in Karakalpakstan,). This is a good option if you want to see the ship graveyard and head towards the silk road. Istanbul: Flights are common, I came through Istanbul, Kebabistan. Tblissi: A lot of flights as well, it might be a decent option. Comments?

This article is part of a longer one through the Himalaya This was a guided tour, but I leave it open for those that can travel freely\n____\nItinerary done quick (Insert preferred flag here) Tibet Day Destination Notes Day 1 Arrival in Lhasa Arrive + Norbulingka Day 2 Lhasa Drepung \u0026amp; Sera Monasteries Day 3 Lhasa Potala - Jokhang - Barkhor Day 4 Gyantse Shigatse Lake Yamdrok, Korola \u0026amp; Gyantse Day 5 Everest Base Camp Shigatse and EBC Day 6 Gyirong EBC + Gyirong Day 7 Nepalese border Leave to Kathmandu Day 1 Lhasa I arrived in Lhasa by plane from nearly nearby Shangri-La, another tibetan city, but in Yunnan. It\u0026rsquo;s 3 days away by car, so the choice of flying was obvious. Trains may exist as well, but that really depends on your starting city, from Yunnan, you have to flight, despite the geographic proximity (1500 km lol).\nI was sick when I arrived, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t visit the Norbulingka palace as intended, if you\u0026rsquo;re healthy, do me a favor and visit it and tell in the comments how it was! Apparently it can be visited independently.\nDay 2 Drepung Sera Drepung and Sera monasteries.\nThe spiritual heart of Lhasa and, by extension, of Tibet. Did I draw you in? Good.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s an interesting day, seeing the monks debating, seeing the high altitude life, having a bird\u0026rsquo;s view on Lhasa, its parks, its life, its vibrancy\u0026hellip; I was too sick to remember plainly, but that filled a day quickly!\nIf you have time, do visit the Tibetan culture museum.\nIt goes in depth on the topic of Tibet\u0026rsquo;s liberation from the evil powers: England, Russia and \u0026ldquo;more\u0026rdquo;. Thanks to China and its peaceful army, they freed the tibetan slaves from the evil alliance of conspirators; Wakanda, Tuvalu and Greenland\u0026hellip;\nDay 3 Potala palace Fuuuuuuu-sion! Sorry, those were the potara earrings.\nSo, the potala palace is the masterpiece of Lhasa and Tibet. I would say hat Tibet is worth visiting just for the palace, it\u0026rsquo;s truly a world wonder.\nThe whole morning was dedicated to the Potala palace. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen every angle, went to the top (I fully recovered from my illness, it was due to bad food.) and enjoyed it so much!\nAfter the Potala palace, I went right under, to Barkhor Street, to see the monastery, the last one of the big 3: Jokhang! There are also a few museum around the area, and a hidden KFC, posing as a traditional building. Or perhaps it was there since the ancient times, who knows.\nKFC in Gyantse\nDay 4 Gyantse You got a guide? Yes? You can leave the city. Let\u0026rsquo;s make our way to the EBC!\nBut first, we need to stop at every possible viewpoint, because you made it to the Himalaya, bitch!\nThe lake Yamdrok is pretty, with its azure color, but is a bit touristy. Gyantse is a quick stop, there is one fortification I saw from after. It\u0026rsquo;s still the title of the section, but that was boring. The Korola glacier was completely filled with trash. I cleaned as much as I could under the laugher of the chinese, throwing gas bottles and plastic everywhere they went knowing I would pick it up. Some guys helped me, french obviously, then we were met by younger chinese people (\u0026lt; 30) that gave more than a hand. I think that, together, we picked up half a dozen kilo. Yay. Yup, that\u0026rsquo;s all I remember from the melted glacier, take that how you want.\nAfter that, we stopped in Shigatse for the night. Ate some delicious food in a restaurant in the old city, that was great.\nDay 5 EBC After a quick visit of the little palace in Shigatse, very interesting while similar to those of Lhasa, we took the long winding road to the Everest Base Camp. Probably seven hours on a mountain road. Thanks god it was a good one, yet, it was still a drive I\u0026rsquo;ll remember. Folks, don\u0026rsquo;t lose you hearing, ever since I lost my sence of balance and I get sick in transports.\nEverest Base Camp is big, very big. There are a lot of tents with ten times as many dancing chinese. They party as they made it to the world\u0026rsquo;s roof, in front of the incredible Everest. I managed to see the peak, some were there for a week, only to catch that specific glimpse. It lasted like 20 minutes during the day, another 20 at night. Look at the cool pictures.\nDay 6 Gyirong Before leaving EBC, we visited one of the world\u0026rsquo;s highest monastery Rongbuk. It\u0026rsquo;s not interesting architecturally, but there\u0026rsquo;s a bit of history (destroyed by Mao Zedong forces, rebuilt by Deng Xiaoping\u0026rsquo;s policies. Life\u0026rsquo;s harsh up there)\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t go to Kathmandu, you go back to Lhasa. I went on to Nepal, with a very small group.\nWe made a stop for lunch in a town in the middle of nowhere, where locals seldom see any foreigners. It was weird to have everyone gawking at our very small group. For some, it was the first time they saw a man with long hair, weird isn\u0026rsquo;t it? It was so remote, it was like catching a glimpse into the \u0026ldquo;real tibet\u0026rdquo;.\nWe went past the barley fields, crossed the desert and the dunes, crossed a mountain and\u0026hellip; met a lush jungle. I shit you not, desert to jungle took like, 10 minutes? By driving of course. It\u0026rsquo;s just separated by a single range of mountain. The Himalayas are wild man. Gyirong is another case of a town where locals barely see any westerners. Foreigners, yes, nepali are common, but not a group made of: a German, two french of different ethnicities, a latina and an ashkenazi we met along the way.\nDay 7 Road to Kathmandu Last day!\nAnd a fun one, in a way. The border on the chinese side is super modern, right on time, with a military parade and everything. The nepali side is\u0026hellip; very different. A small mud house with only one entrance, a guy sitting on a stool, in front of a barrel writting things by hand, the \u0026ldquo;roads\u0026rdquo; which are actually just muddy paths. Going from one side to the other makes you go back 30 or 40 years back in time; I\u0026rsquo;m not even joking.\nAnd, important info, if you think this part of the trip is just one long lonely muddy road, well\u0026hellip; That\u0026rsquo;s wrong! You cross a beautiful national park and our driver made many stops along the way, for some excellent viewpoints. If you\u0026rsquo;re lucky, perhaps you may gaze on a very rare Red Panda?\nComments?

Add 2 days in Kunming, 1 in Shaxi, 1 or 2 for Tiger Leaping Gorge and one in Diqing/Shangri-La \u0026ndash; You\u0026rsquo;ll thank me later. Day 1: Kunming ^Yuan Tong\nI Departed from Paris (CDG) to arrive in Kunming (the next day, lol).\nFlights through Asia are often cheaper via Istanbul, Doha, or Bangkok.\nI went through Bangkok. Hence the long time.\nOnce I arrived, I took a walk to the green Park and the Yuan Tong temple, both near each other.\nKunming is big, very big. I stayed two days, but I recommend three or four to better acclimatize to the country\nSince I was there only two days, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t see the Dongchuan Red Land\nDongchuan Red Land on another blog It\u0026rsquo;s a long day trip, doable before and after summer. It\u0026rsquo;s great for photographers, but is an expensive trip\nIf I had one more day, I could also have visited Longmen, Lake Dian and Yunnan Ethnic village (They are all close together)\nDay 2: Stone Forest (Shilin) Morning bus to Shilin, the Stone Forest, about 90 km southeast of Kunming.\nGetting from Kunming to the Stone Forest (Shilin) The Stone Forest (Shílín / 石林) lies about 90 km southeast of Kunming, and the easiest way to reach it is by long-distance bus from Kunming East Bus Station (昆明东部客运站). Take Line 3 to East Bus Station, buy a ticket and travel for almost two hours The ride costs about 35–45 RMB Entrance fee fro Shilin: around 130–175 RMB, depending on season.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a bit pricey, and very touristy in the main areas, but as soon as you stray from the main path you can see many rock formations AND be alone. But the main part is the prettiest one.\nI met some people on the way, we braced the rain, took cool pictures and walked the whole geopark (or it felt like that, 30k steps) Technically, it can be visited in one long morning, I decided to spend as much time as possible.\nIf you have time in the evening, I recommend visiting one of Kunming old city, those are good places to get food and see some sights! I went around Wuhua, but Guandu is an option.\nDay 3: Dali Salvador??? Not this dalí, actually, but it\u0026rsquo;s even better.\nAlright, take a morning train to Dali (8:30 departure, arrival around noon), followed by a bus. I just asked around and got dropped near my hotel in Old Town. Because, yes, the train station is n the new Deli, to the south of Lake Erhai. The old town is south west.\nThey are well connected, so it\u0026rsquo;s easy to visit.\nI spent the whole afternoon exploring Dali Ancient Town and the Three Pagodas.\nThe place is charming and walkable, surrounded by mountains and Lake Erhai to the east.\nIt was pretty easy to navigate, the old town is quite small actually.\nMany hikes are available around, but beware of the weather\nA long afternoon of nonstop walking was enough to see 75% of Old Dali. And I had to rush a bit.\nDay 4: Lake Erhai \u0026amp; Xizhou Near the lake (around Caicun Wharf) there are many bikes to rent. I borrowed one for a small amount of money (A shitty one ^^\u0026rsquo;) and did a loop around Lake Erhai, heading toward Xizhou Village.\nFlat, scenic, and easy to navigate, though the ride is long, very long. My bike wasn\u0026rsquo;t the best either, but its just pathetic excuses.\nThe ride is a mere 20 km one way, Or two hours and a halfish when running. But there are many nice spots and stops along the way, I spent quite a lot of this riding time to gaze at the architecture.\nBe careful of the sun, the altitude is high and despite the cloudiness and the rain, I got sunburnt.\n^Pretty little house\nI arrived in Xizhou around noon, just in time to eat some street food in the old town. My bike was parked outside the city, the best I could, no way around it.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s one of the nicest day trips in Yunnan, with good weather, it\u0026rsquo;s a joy. And, my, the architecture, once again, it\u0026rsquo;s so pretty. The flowers, the house, the rice fields, the weddings\u0026hellip; Such a beautiful little trip.\nYes, I loved it.\nI spent my evening in Dali old town again. It\u0026rsquo;s lovely and the restaurants are many.\nDay 5: Lijiang Bus from Dali Old Town to Lijiang (8:30 departure, arrival around 11:30).\nThere are many buses you can catch from old town, as many do this trip. Train are also running, but that means going back to new town, so depending on your accomodation or your love of Didi (Nice try), it\u0026rsquo;s not ideal.\nIf you have one more day, you can stop in Shaxizhen, but it requires a change of bus in Jianchuan. It\u0026rsquo;s doable as a long day trip, but with your luggage and everything, it\u0026rsquo;s not the best. I heard no feedback about Shaxi.\nAnyway, spend the afternoon in Lijiang Old Town: crowded but beautiful. The must is a walk to Black Dragon Pool and to the less crowded Shuhe Village. I did walk to Shuhe, the bus system is a bit hard for foreigners, but locals are helpful. So I came back by bus.\nNote: Lijiang is actually really big. Even though it doesn\u0026rsquo;t look like it. Once again, if buses are too hard, Didi is your friend.\nI stayed above the old town so I could have a bird eye view of Lijiang.\n^Lijiang at night\nDay 6: Lijiang Jade Dragon Snow Mountain Day trip to Blue Moon Valley and the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain area.\nAltitude hits 4500m near the top, so bring warm clothes even in summer.\nThere are organized shuttles that make it easy to visit without hiking too hard.\nThe turquoise water and mountain views are stunning when the weather clears and you can go yak spotting. Or Jacks, as they call it with their wrong french translation.\nFor me the highlight was definitely the Blue moon valley and the lakes. They have stunning colors and a nice shimmer, the signs around are hilarious if you can read french (Yes they are translated in French for some reason), like one said forbidden to assholes instead of Smoking is prohibited. And one, in english, said something like ecleptic car paint instead of electrical car. Yup.\nIf you have time and can understand chinese, you can checkout the Theatre: Impression Lijiang. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen it from afar, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t understand anything.\n^Looks like Pamukkale\nDay 7: Lijiang Tiger Leaping Gorge I couldn\u0026rsquo;t do it due to time constraints (Visa was only 15 days when I went - I was heading to tibet afterward) So I missed the Leaping Tiger Gorge, only seeing it from afar (Very far~).\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s definitely a good spot to visit.\nTransportation runs regularly between Lijiang, the gorge and Shangri-La. But be careful, the logistic to do it this way might be hard\nDay 8: Shangri-La Bus north to Shangri-La (Also known Zhongdian), around 4 to 5 hours.\nAltitude here is 3200m, if you\u0026rsquo;re weak to altitude you may feel it.\nVisit the Old Town and the huge Ganden Sumtseling Monastery, but if you look closely with the last one, you\u0026rsquo;ll see there\u0026rsquo;s no gold, it\u0026rsquo;s yellow paint.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s not much to do, but it fills a full day. There are hikes around, I met friends that went for two days, from the pictures I\u0026rsquo;ve been sent, it\u0026rsquo;s visually very close to Tibet proper. So if you want to extend your trip, do take one more day to see around, the best way to get info on hikes is to ask the hostel directly, they had many documents on nearby hikes, but most need transportation to and from. (Didi is your friend)\nShangri-La marks the end of the road for most Yunnan routes; from here, people often head back to Lijiang or continue toward Sichuan. I went to Lhasa by flight, it was direct and relatively cheap. It\u0026rsquo;s not doable\nPractical Notes Transport: trains between Kunming–Dali and buses for the rest. Booking: Trip.com works fine; hostels can help too. Budget: around 30–40 € per day once you\u0026rsquo;re there. SIM \u0026amp; Apps: Amap (now in English) + Alipay are essential. Best season: March to October apparently, though summer rains can hit. One week was way too short, man, now that the visa free policy is for 30 days (Check if it applies to you), it\u0026rsquo;s much better I would have rather done 12 days or something, I loved it so much On the plus side, I can return there and enjoy it again!\nComments?

Walk in, ask around, you\u0026rsquo;ll find a deal. Budget: You can realistically get three days for under 400 €. That usually includes park fees, guide, car, fuel, accommodation (camping or budget lodges), and food. Group tours: Cheaper if you join others instead of booking private. Groups are usually 4–6 people per car. Note: I went in 2023, prices must have hiked up. Expect 450 or even 500€, inflation is a bitch.\nWhere to Book Local agencies are the key.\nFor example, in Arusha (Tanzania), there\u0026rsquo;s an agency literally next to the Arusha Backpackers Hostel. I walked in and had a tour booked within hours.\nOtherwise, it\u0026rsquo;s Africa, everyone knows a guy. People will even approach you, just wait and pick the best option, lol.\nPractical Tips SIM card first: As soon as you land, get a local SIM. Makes it easier to coordinate with agencies, guides, and fellow travelers. And for safety. You might need it. Believe me. What to bring: Warm clothes for nights, sunglasses, sunscreen, power bank, and a decent camera if you care about photos. Food \u0026amp; water: Usually included, but it\u0026rsquo;s smart to have extra snacks. Is it Worth It? Absolutely. Even on a budget trip, you still see the same lions, elephants, giraffes, and endless savannahs as the people who paid ten times more.\nThe only difference: they\u0026rsquo;re sipping wine in a lodge at night, and you\u0026rsquo;re in a tent.\nFor me, that trade-off is more than fine.\nHowever, truth be told, sometimes it feels a bit \u0026ldquo;on rail\u0026rdquo;. It was like going to the Thoiry Zoo near Paris, seeing one animal after the other in a way that was crafter by the guide. I was tired on the third day, it felt a bit too similar. I\u0026rsquo;m not that crazy about wildlife, so it checks out.\nComments?

It sums up the tools and tricks that are often crucial, especially when moving between different countries and cultures. Always check country-specific advice!\n(No shame: I used a helpful AI Assistant (Gemini) for quick formatting and to synthesize common advice)\n🌍 Essential Apps \u0026amp; Tools Google Maps / HERE Maps / Maps.me Google Maps is generally reliable in large cities and for major routes. Maps.me and Organic Maps are often better for offline use and in remote/safari areas. Rather accurate for major landmarks, but off-road tracks can be misleading. /!\\ Download offline maps for every region you plan to visit before you lose connectivity. WhatsApp It\u0026rsquo;s the primary communication tool for most people and businesses. You\u0026rsquo;ll use it to message tour guides, lodges, taxi drivers, and new friends. Google Translate /!\\ Download language packs (e.g., Swahili, Afrikaans, French, Portuguese\u0026hellip;) for offline use. The camera function is useful for menus and signs, but not always perfect for complex dialects. (Like in Ethiopia) Currency Converter (e.g., XE Currency) Essential with over 50 currencies and fluctuating exchange rates. Great for quick conversion when bargaining in markets to ensure a fair price. VPNs are generally, not needed, as most major international sites are accessible. A security-focused VPN is still useful for protecting your data on potentially unsecured public Wi-Fi, which happens a lot.\n🚗 Transportation Booking Flights \u0026amp; Overland Domestic Flights: Recommended for covering the continent\u0026rsquo;s vast distances quickly (e.g., between South Africa and Kenya). Overland Tours/4x4 Rental: The most common way for safaris and exploring remote parks. Using a local travel agent or the airline/bus company website directly is often best. Ride-Hailing Apps (Uber, Bolt, Indriver) Uber and Bolt are common, while Indriver is popular in parts of West and North Africa. Generally considered a safer, more transparent option than hailing a street taxi. Payment is easiest by linking a foreign card to the app. Minibuses \u0026amp; Shared Taxis Also known as Matatus (Kenya), Tro-tros (Ghana), or Daladalas (Tanzania). Extremely cheap and authentic but often crowded, less comfortable, and do not follow a strict timetable (they leave when full). 💰 Payments Mobile Money (M-Pesa, Airtel Money) Mobile Money is King in East Africa (Kenya, Tanzania) and increasingly common elsewhere. It\u0026rsquo;s a phone number-based payment system used for nearly everything, from street vendors to park entry fees. Non-residents can usually register for a Mobile Money account with a local SIM card and passport. Cash (USD/Local Currency) Cash is Essential and widely used. Many local markets, small shops, and rural areas are cash-only. US Dollars (USD): Widely accepted (and often required) for visas, major tourist expenses, and tips. Only bring new, clean, post-2006 bills—old or damaged notes are often rejected. Credit/Debit Cards: Widely accepted in high-end hotels, major supermarkets, and tourist centers in major cities. Expect surcharges of 3-10% in some places. Visa and MasterCard are most common. ATMs: Available in cities and towns. Use bank ATMs during the day and be discreet.\nInform your home bank of your travel dates to avoid card freezing.\nOther Notes SIM Card: Buying a local SIM card is cheap and vital for navigation, ride-hailing, and Mobile Money. Trains vs flights: For distances under 1,000 km, often a high-quality intercity bus is the most reliable balance between speed and cost, as train networks are limited. Toilets: Varies greatly; carry tissues and hand sanitizer. Etiquette \u0026amp; Safety: Publicly displaying wealth (expensive phones, jewelry) is discouraged in cities. Always ask before taking a picture of a person. Be patient, polite, and embrace the concept of \u0026ldquo;Africa Time\u0026rdquo; (things move slowly). Politics/Military: Avoid sensitive topics, queue firmly, and never take pictures of government, police, or military installations. Comments?

Don\u0026rsquo;t trust the police.\nNever try to flirt with policewomen. They\u0026rsquo;re not up for it.\nSpend your day exploring Meskel Square, the Ethnological Museum, and the National Museum of Ethiopia (where Lucy rests).\nI also really liked, Saint George\u0026rsquo;s church and its turtles as well as the Holy trinity Cathedral. In the late afternoon, I went up Mount Entoto*, it\u0026rsquo;s an easy hike up.\nAt night, Addis\u0026rsquo; food scene shines, try Shiro, Injera, and local honey wine (if you\u0026rsquo;re an alcohoolic).\nDay 2 Gondar From Addis, I took a long and early bus (11h) to Gondar, the “Camelot of Africa.”\nThere were afew nice stops, but essentialy, it was a wasted day.\nOn my first evening in Gonder, I walked around my accomodation and spoke with other travelers. If you have more time, try to see the Fasilides Bath, a bit out of the center, or even the Debre Birhan Selassie Church.\n(Wikivoyage) https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Gondar This article is outdated, yet still useful.\nDay 3 and 4 Simien Mountains ^Gelada Baboons\nWith a very small group I left Gondar early, heading into the Simiens\nYou need both a guide and an armed ranger to enter the park.\nWe waited nearly two hours at the ranger station before being allowed in (there was no one, lol).\nIn the meantime, we enjoyed coffee and watched the broken UN cars going through.\nIt was a nice visit, even though it was super cloudy. The mountains are beautiful, the baboons ever present and the air felt nice. Many locals around, showing you their handicrafts, the guide and the ranger telling little stories\u0026hellip;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a good trip, really.\nBy the time we set camp, the rain was coming down hard.\nAnd on the same night, amidst the storm, a mexican tourist heard the gunshots By paying attention, yup, not just rain. Trust the mexican on that.\nThe second day was pretty much the same as the previous day, with a few other viewpoints, especially cliffs and waterfalls. We saw more Gelada baboons and a lot of birds.\nDay 5 Gondar ^African Camelot\nStone castles rise from green hills; Fasil Ghebbi is a surreal sight, it looks a bit like medieval Europe.\nAfter a morning around the castles (You HAVE to hire a guide), I spent the afternoon exploring the city and its sights.\nI also met a nice chinese man named James with whom I travelled manyfolds during the same trip\nHonestly, Gondar is not a very long visit. Some parts of the centers are nice and riding the many rickshaws is nice.\nCareful for the scams, you agree on a price, then say it\u0026rsquo;s 100 times that amount. 100€ for 5 minutes is a bit much.\nDay 6 Bahir Dar The drive to Bahir Dar is short (3 hours), resting on the edge of Lake Tana, it\u0026rsquo;s a wealthy town.\nOn my day there, I went to visit the Martyr\u0026rsquo;s Memorial, ate at Bet Diplomat, went around the markets and walked around the lake, there\u0026rsquo;s a nice promenade.\nDay 7 Blue Nile Falls / Lake Tana monasteries ^Blue Niles falls\nAn early bus ride and a muddy hike to the Blue Nile Falls.\nEven muddy as hell in July, it\u0026rsquo;s still beautiful.\nAt the entrance, they will force a guide upon you, saying you will get lost otherwise: It\u0026rsquo;s a lie. The guide I had kept trying to offer me prostitutes and kept saying he let tourists fucked this or that girl (Sometimes, they were kids and teens. Absolutely disgusting.)\nIn the afternoon, I went to see Lake Tana and its monasteries.\nScammers are rampant here, especially for the boat tours. They\u0026rsquo;ll approach you, speaking of a “student boat association”, it\u0026rsquo;s fake.\nStick to official operators or boats arranged by your hotel/hostel.\nDay 8 Road to Lalibela The bus journey to Lalibela takes a full day, winding through dusty Gashena.\nIt doable in one day, you just have to start early. As soon as I reached Gashena, the bus driver pointed at shared taxis and I immediately got into one going north. It was easier than I thought.\nOtherwise, there is nothing to see on the road, it\u0026rsquo;s essentially a wasted day.\nDay 9 Lalibela The fabled rock-hewn churches of Lalibela, twelve monolithic masterpieces carved directly into the mountain.\nWhen I arrived, the entrance price had jumped from $50 to $100.\nGuides are extra (5–50 USD depending on the priest), and\u0026hellip; most priests now carry iPhones.\nTheir greed sicken me.\nBeware of fake priests: they\u0026rsquo;ll offer cheap tours, but can\u0026rsquo;t explain the ceremonies, or even where they “work.”\nStill, nothing diminishes the awe.\nWalking barefoot through dim tunnels carved in rock, hearing prayers echo, it\u0026rsquo;s timeless.\nDay 10 Lalibela (Monasteries) Another day around Lalibela!\nI visited surrounding monasteries and met locals. The dude working at my hotel\u0026rsquo;s reception was quite nice and showed me around (for a price, of course) Other than the monasteries and revisiting the rock church, I advise you to eat at Ben Abeba, a scottish fusion restaurant in a nice area.\nDay 11 Lalibela to Harar Quick flight to Dire Dawa, then shuttle to Harar.\nIf you take the bus route instead (two full days via Dessie), be prepared for a whole bunch of nothing.\nJames did it, said it was disappointing, Dessie had nothing to do and the road was shitty.\nHarar felt different, with its arabic influences, colorful walls and stronger tourism industry. Add to that the smell of Harari coffee, it sure is nicer. I arrived a bit late in the day, despite the flights, so I mostly enjoyed dinner and slept.\nDay 12 Harar ^ Harar with Solomon\nOld stone alleys, green chat leaves, and the instagram-famous hyena feeding.\nAround early noon, I met Solomon, a witty Rasta-looking man who works part-time at a museum.\nIf he offers to guide you, he\u0026rsquo;s the real deal. Not a scammer.\nYou can even find him online, but this feels outdated: Solomon Harar, Ethiopia\nWe talked for hours about history and his life, with my friend James we toured the whole walled city, went people watching, enjoyed street food\u0026hellip; And we met him again in the evening to see the hyenas, he showed us more cool things during the night. Truly the best.\nNote: He might have moved to Israel with his wife, I met him in 2023, the ticker ticks, people move The ebbs and flows of life take people to the waves and the clouds.\n^Harar without Solomon, but James\u0026rsquo; cameo\nDay 13 Return to Addis Ababa I didn\u0026rsquo;t take the train, buses suited our timing better (we departed at night to get time in Addis).\nTerrible choice. I got stuck beside a fat muslim woman over 100 kg, sweating rivers and stiking like poo. The ride felt eternal, the mercury went up to 47°C around midway.\nEthiopian hates opening windows in cars, something about bad luck, I think? That\u0026rsquo;s why I recommend taking the train, + it\u0026rsquo;s french infrastructure.\nThat night, I went out with my chinese travel partner to Yob Abyssinia, a traditional restaurant, famous on Google Maps.\nIt was fun seeing the dances and being invited on stage! The food was meh, though.\nOn the way back, we got robbed (James\u0026rsquo; phone got stollen by three big guys, it turned into a fistfight, which we easily won.\nWe were two and they were only three, lol. Not a dull moment in Addis. Never\u0026hellip;\nAddis is full of prostitutes, robbers and glue sniffers, I don\u0026rsquo;t advise walking at night. Some robbers have knives. Unless you are strong enough to fend two weapon-wielding low lives, be careful.\nDay 14 Arba Minch From Addis, a long bus ride south toward Arba Minch, gateway to the Omo Valley.\nThere, James and I got approached by Miju, a Hamar guide with missing teeth.\nWe visited the town and around, see the lakes and the crocodiles. Apart from shopping for tours, the only real good thing to do is to see the Dorze tribe. I did it on the next day, so once again, it was pretty much a wasted day.\nTo find a guide, ask for Nairobi. He\u0026rsquo;s the leader, he may not always work as a guide, but apparently he\u0026rsquo;s the best. If he\u0026rsquo;s busy, he\u0026rsquo;ll recommend you someone else. That\u0026rsquo;s how I ended up with Miju.\nDays 15 to 17 Omo Valley Tribes ^Miju in the market\nYou have a choice of transportation. I did mine.\nWith my guide, we rode motorbikes and hitched trucks after the second day since Miju was too lazy/tired to drive.\nOn the first day, I visited the Dorze, drank with the king and watched demos of cooking methods. As well as tasted dishes and alcohol.\nOn the second and third day, we met the Hamar, Mursi, and Konso tribes, each with their customs, beauty, and dignity.\nAnd perhaps more, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to remember all the names.\nThe best things to do are:\nGoing to local markets Go people watching Drink and eat with locals Party I liked the lifestyle.\nEven if they are naked in hut, I noticed they all have phones with online games on it. So, yeah, you will see young people playing PUBG and fortnite. Technologia!\nIn Turmi, I got into another street fight, but out of respect for the guides and the Omo valley tourism industry, I\u0026rsquo;ll leave the details out.\n^A tribe in the wild\nDay 18 Konso to Moyale We ended the trip in Konso because I planned to go to Moyale, the border crossing into Kenya.\nTravel advisories mark this area in red, tribal tensions still run deep.\nGunfire between tribes isn\u0026rsquo;t rare, and foreigners should avoid nighttimes.\nThe trip was busy and dusty, people were fighting to get into buses, the border was closed early, I had to sleep in one of the shittiest hotel I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen. No toilets or showers, no water. Just a bed filled with cockroaches. 10€. Take it or leave it.\nMore? If you visit Ethiopia, I recommend skipping Bahir Dar to see Dalol. Or if you have more time, squeeze it somewhere. The issue with Ethiopia is that the roads are terrible, so everything goes through Addis, a real shithole.\nFinal Thoughts Ethiopia is a country that demands patience and respect (and a taste for street fights).\nIt\u0026rsquo;s chaotic, corrupt, alive, and endlessly complex, but it\u0026rsquo;s also one of the last places where travel still feels wild. I don\u0026rsquo;t recommend it, but if you\u0026rsquo;re keen for it, I hope that my itinerary will be of use.\nComments?\n","date":"August 15, 2023","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cpicture\u003e\n          \u003csource\n            \n              srcset=\"/images/blog/eth0b_hu_5d65b10d667ebff9.webp\"\n            \n            media=\"(max-width: 575px)\" /\u003e\n          \u003csource\n            \n              srcset=\"/images/blog/eth0b_hu_ca5c305434da6d6a.webp\"\n            \n            media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" /\u003e\n          \u003csource\n            \n              srcset=\"/images/blog/eth0b_hu_a114dff0ff121148.webp\"\n            \n            media=\"(max-width: 991px)\" /\u003e\n          \u003csource\n            \n              srcset=\"/images/blog/eth0b_hu_e9f41a5eda856700.webp\"\n             /\u003e\n          \u003cimg\n            \n              loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n              src=\"/images/blog/eth0b_hu_36ba5fd23f744ff.jpg\"\n            \n            \n            class=\"  img\"\n            alt=\"\"\n            width=\"1365\"\n            height=\"768\" /\u003e\n        \u003c/picture\u003e\n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n","permalink":"/blog/itinerary-ethiopia/","title":"3 weeks in Ethiopia"},{"categories":["Itinerary","Africa"],"contents":" Tanzania, Kenya, Ouganda \u0026amp; Rwanda: 4 Countries in one month!\n\u0026gt; As I\u0026rsquo;m starting with this blog, I\u0026rsquo;ll share in a slightly different format.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll start with my usual considerations before giving an itinerary outline and an even more detailed version of the itinerary.\noriginally, it was supposed to last one more week, it changed due to a awful event that happened And shook me up, I\u0026rsquo;ll specify the section that has been changed.\n(Loading test, there is a cross-site cookie issue on my dev server)\nBefore diving into my itinerary, a few considerations:\nEnglish is the Lingua Franca in the region, but in Rwanda many people speak french instead I actually came from Ethiopia, crossing through Kenya using the Moyale border Backpacking is not a big thing in East Africa It might be dangerous at times, I don\u0026rsquo;t recommend going alone It\u0026rsquo;s by no mean a cheap destination Info is hard to get online, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to bring as much useful intel I can Prices date from 2023, might have hiked up in the meantime ____\nNote: This article detailing logistic can be a nice read as well\nTips on how to travel Africa I got this one too, for Cheap safaris!\nTips for Cheap Safaris Itinerary done quick 🇹🇿 TANZANIA Day Destination Notes Day 1 Arusha Arrival, Safari prep Day 2 Arusha - Tarangire Safari - Tarangire Day 3 Arusha - Ngorongoro Safari - Ngorongoro Day 4 Arusha - Manyara Safari - Manyara Day 5 Moshi Transfer Day 6 Moshi Hike foot of Kilimanjaro Day 7 Lushoto Scenic drive Day 8 Lushoto Hiking Day 9 Zanzibar Long bus Dar + ferry Day 10 Zanzibar - Stone Town Stone Town Day 11 Zanzibar - Prison Island Prison island + sand beach Day 12 Zanzibar - Spices Spice tour + boat in the evening Day 13 Kilwa Masoko South coast Day 14 Kilwa Kisiwani Ruins visit Day 15 Kilwa Kivanje Around Kilwa Day 16 Dar es Salaam Return + visit Day 17 Bagamoyo Stopover 🇰🇪 KENYA Day Destination Notes Day 18 Mombasa Border crossing Day 19 Mombasa Old town \u0026amp; more Day 20 Nairobi - Train Afternoon train Day 21 Nairobi Explore Day 22 Nairobi - NP Day trip to National Park 🇺🇬 UGANDA Day Destination Notes Day 23 Kampala Long road into Uganda + city Day 24 Kampala City day Day 25 Fort Portal Long transfer Day 26 Rwenzori Trek Day 27 Rwenzori Trek Day 28 Kabale The worst road\u0026hellip; Day 29 Lake Bunyoni Lake Bunyonyi 1 Day 30 Lake Bunyoni Lake Bunyonyi 2 🇷🇼 RWANDA Day Destination Notes Day 31 Kigali Enter Rwanda, rest Day 32 Kigali Enjoy the city Day 33 Ruhengeri Arrive and prepare Day 34 Volcanoes NP Volcanoes/Gorillas Day 35 Kibuye Get to see Lake Kivu Day 36 Kigali Departure That\u0026rsquo;s it! Do click on the links (destination name) to learn more!\nTanzania Day 1 Arrival in Arusha Most travelers land at Kilimanjaro Airport and reach Arusha by shuttle, some cross the border from Kenya (There are border transfer services, it last around 6 hours and it was an easy border. Be prepared to have a lot of people selling you stuff) And other takes a long bus from Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania\u0026rsquo;s capital. Apparently it\u0026rsquo;s a gruesome 10 hours. Otherwise, it\u0026rsquo;s a bit less than 3 hours from Moshi.\nI actually came by land from Moyale in Ethiopia. It took me two days and a half, in retrospect, that was a stupid move. (For those interested (???) I went Konso -\u0026gt; Yabelo -\u0026gt; Moyale -\u0026gt; Slept at the border -\u0026gt; Marsabit -\u0026gt; Nairobi -\u0026gt; Slept in the streets -\u0026gt; Arusha) I saw a lot of landscapes along the way and did encounter funny people, strange locals and saw tribes out and about, it\u0026rsquo;s part of the adventure.\nAnyway, use the afternoon to get oriented, withdraw a good amount of cash, VERY IMPORTANT TO DO buy a local SIM (Vodacom or Airtel), and check a few safari agencies. I like to do my \u0026ldquo;shopping\u0026rdquo; with local agencies, even though prices are pretty much aligned.\nMore tips here (I\u0026rsquo;m lazy, I won\u0026rsquo;t C-Paste my content): Tips for Cheap Safaris. Join a group with a local operator: it\u0026rsquo;s easy to arrange last minute, and you can get three-days safaris under 500€.\nArusha isn\u0026rsquo;t the prettiest city, there aren\u0026rsquo;t a lot of sights: a few Hindu temples, gardens and a couple of art centers; I\u0026rsquo;d say that it\u0026rsquo;s more than enough for an afternoon.\nWelcome to Africa btw.\nDay 2 Arusha – Safari (Tarangire) I went on a three days safari with the local agency linked to the Arusha Backpackers hostel, (I don\u0026rsquo;t remember the name), A Tunisian guy, Bessa - owner of the first hostel in Tunis helped me, out with the negociations. It\u0026rsquo;s always better negociating with a friend.\nSafaris starts early. Expect a long drive into Tarangire, a forested area famous for its elephants (see the picture). The day was kinda long, but it was a blast, very reminescent of Thoiry back home (it\u0026rsquo;s a drive-in Zoo). It was my first real safari and that was really exciting, I was beaming!\nYour guide will help you spot all the wildlife, but they will normally remain pretty far from the animals, especially if they are a licensed guide that respect this very same wildlife.\nI slept in a tent in a camp, where I listened to Jambo Bwana for the first time. It was fun and simple.\nThe big five can be spotted right from the first day, if ya lucky\nDay 3 Arusha – Safari (Ngorongoro) Wake up before sunrise to enter the Ngorongoro Crater.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a long descent into a massive bowl of wildlife, in the coldest of morning. When I went it was overly misty: Visibility was shit. The first few hours were rough and we missed the migration by weeks, changes in weather patterns messed things up\u0026hellip;\nSee the picture for the view/weather. Not that bad, actually, right? We spotted wildlife every 5 minutes or something, it felt like a railshooter. Anyone played Pokemon Snap before? That\u0026rsquo;s the feeling.\nWe camped near the Crater\u0026rsquo;s rim. You can hear the animals at night, noice.\nFact: Technically, the Ngorongoro is part of the Serengeti, even though it\u0026rsquo;s a different NP\nFact 2: The name is supposedly the sound of a bell\nDay 4 Arusha – Safari (Manyara) Final day of my safari, visiting Lake Manyara National Park.\nFewer crowds and good birdlife + Monke. It was my less favorite. I got tired after the first few hours. Safaris are not for me, they get exhausting after a while/\nManyara is home to the tree climbing lions, have fun trying to spot them!\nDay 5 Road to Moshi In the morning, I went to see the waterfalls near Arusha. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t worth it, folks try to make you pay every half hour and they are boring. So\u0026hellip; Take a morning bus or shared minivan to Moshi (2–3 h).\nThey are easy to find near the main bus station in Arusha, people will propose you the bus even if you don\u0026rsquo;t ask anyway.\nThe town of Moshi sits at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro. That\u0026rsquo;s the target. If you\u0026rsquo;re lucky, you might see it in its full glory.\nI went in the later afternoon, it was a hard mistake. Always arrive at your destination during day time.\nStory time: I came at night, had no sim card (I forgot) and my hostel (Mad Vervet Moshi) was a junkie nest where someone kidnapped me and forcefully brought me to an hotel with naked guys. So\u0026hellip; Avoid, be careful, don\u0026rsquo;t go alone. Be safe. This is no joke.\nDay 6 Moshi Shaken by the event of the day before I just went on a half-day hike around Materuni Falls, at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro.\nI met a nice man, that helped me immensely and spent time with his family. A nice \u0026ldquo;tuk-tuk\u0026rdquo; driver with a heart of Gold. I also switched hotel and found a safer place.\nStory time 2: I had been with the police the night before. Had a contact with them, but they were off. In a restaurant, far from the crime, Another policeman talked to me, heard about the case, gave me his phone number and all. Said it was just in case, to keep me safe, as the police deals in dark trades. Actually, he just wanted to you-know-what. I had to block him due to the almost nude pictures of himself he sent me. Thrice. He called with different numbers and tried to find me in the city.\nDay 7 Road to Lushoto I took a bus, early in the morning, trying to escape the dense gay policeman.\nIt was a long ride (6–7 h) through the mountains toward Lushoto in the Usambara Hills.\nThat part of my trip is blurry. I can\u0026rsquo;t recall much. I slept in a new hostel by the road, a bit higher than the town. A man named Emanuel and his family settled there and do honey keeping. I shared meals with them as well as watch a few show on the local TV.\nDay 8 Lushoto ^A view of Lushoto from the heights\nI Spent the day hiking to the Irente Viewpoint. The trail was nice, going through nature fror some bits and through local villages with nice kids greeting you at every opportunity. All of this was still a blur for me.\nDay 9 Road to Zanzibar ^Dar-Es-Salaam seen from the dock\nI caught a morning bus toward Dar es Salaam (6 hours?), then the ferry to Zanzibar (2 hours?).\nTo get the bus, I asked Emmanuel, the hostel owner to call the company and they picked me up in front of the hostel. It was super late and took forever to reach Dar, more than it was supposed to. I arrived around 3:30/4:00 PM and caught a ferry by taking a motorbike from the first bus station, I was scared of being late\u0026hellip; But, I made it in time, with half an hour of earliness to validate my ticket and everything.\nCareful at the docks, there are many places selling fake tickets, hundreds of scammers and weirdoes. I had to fight my way through, it was physical.\nThe trip is relaxing and comfy, the waves hadn\u0026rsquo;t started yet. Expect to arrive by evening to visit the beautiful Stone Town after dark; it\u0026rsquo;s safer and lively.\nDay 10 Stone Town ^The dispensary in Old town, it\u0026rsquo;s a medical center\nExplore the maze of Stone Town by daylight: the Old Fort, the markets, and the sea promenade.\nI ate at Forodhani Gardens, where locals grill food every night, it\u0026rsquo;s overrated. For lunch I went to a local shop and had much better food. Small hole in the wall without a name. Ate there for most meals afterwards.\nI recommend seeing the Jail for some hardcore history, the fort to see the activities (it\u0026rsquo;s lively), the palaces, eventually Freddy Mercury house, and\u0026hellip; just enjoy!\nI liked Stone Town quite a bit.\nI saw the sellers in the famous market shit behind their stall, close to the merchandise 🤮\nDay 11 Prison Island and Beach ^For the beach lovers\nTake a boat/tour to Prison Island to see the giant tortoises and the jail then spend the afternoon on one of the nearby sandbanks or beaches.\nI found a local agency at the fort with good tours, they were a blast to speak with (Jambo tour or smth like that) and where neatly organized.\n(If you want more comfort and relaxation, base yourself in Nungwi or Paje for the next days. I heard good things, except for the male prostitutes)\nDay 12 Spice Tour Join a spice tour inland! I went with the same tour company as the day before. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit touristy, but worth it for the smells and samples (Plus, I was alone, so I had my very own private tour to the farm) That\u0026rsquo;s a good half day spent for something important.\nIn the evening, hop on a small dhow boat for sunset and/or return to Dar. I did the later as my bus left very early.\nDay 13 Road to Kilwa Masoko Ferry back to Dar, then catch a southbound bus (8–9 h) toward Kilwa Masoko.\nThere were two bus to Kilwa: One leaves at 5:30, the other at noon. There might be other companies, but I have no intel on those. To get the bus I mototaxied to the station Mbagala Rangi Tatu and caught the bus at 7AM (Might have been late). At the bus station, there were those balls snacks that the Malagasy often make, it\u0026rsquo;s bloody delicious!\nThe road was long and without any major sight, everything looked the same until the azure coast. Onward it\u0026rsquo;s just villages, with a lovely pace of life.\nAfter a long time I reached the hostel: The Slow Leopard. Absolutely amazing quality! They also have another location in Dar, I definitely recommend it.\nI spent the evening relaxing and shopping for tours to Kilwa Kisiwani. I ended up going with the tourism information center, this was the most obvious choice.\nDay 14 Kilwa Kisiwani I\u0026rsquo;m bad at taking pictures, and the sun wasn\u0026rsquo;t nice to me.\nVisit the Kilwa Kisiwani ruins: once a major Swahili trading port and a World Wonder in Sid Meier\u0026rsquo;s Civilization VI. Yes, that\u0026rsquo;s why I went.\nWe got a boat for two (I met a scientist along the way) We were only two tourists!\nIt\u0026rsquo;s calm, scenic and pictures can\u0026rsquo;t do it justice\u0026hellip; It was expensive, quite a detour and exhausting, but I don\u0026rsquo;t regret it.\nDay 15 Kilwa Kivanje I visited the nearby Kilwas with the guide from the tourism bureau. It\u0026rsquo;s not particularily interesting, but I was a much cheaper visit and it was relaxing. I then spent the evening relaxing at the beach. You\u0026rsquo;ll need that before continuing your way south to Mozambique or back north to Kenya.\nDay 16 Back to Dar es Salaam Return north (6–7 h).\nIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t yet, explore Dar-Es-Salam a bit. I didn\u0026rsquo;t really like the city, it had no soul. But I had to waste a day here (So two days of transport wasted to See Kilwa, do what you want)\nDar is known for being a bit unsafe, be careful if visiting alone\nDay 17 Bagamoyo Short bus from Dar (1h 30 min).\nBagamoyo is a small coastal town with colonial buildings, it\u0026rsquo;s like Lamu or Tanga: A typical Swahili coast city.\nA quiet final stop before crossing into Kenya and a good way to slightly break the trip. To sleep, either: In Bagamoyo, back to Dar, or in Tanga, a bit more north.\nWhat did I do? I don\u0026rsquo;t know\u0026hellip; I relapsed a bit and the blur started again.\nDay 18 Road to Mombasa Early bus through Lunga Lunga border post.\nExpect an almost full-day ride and an arrival in Mombasa by evening.\nFind accommodation near the Old Town: There aren\u0026rsquo;t many places for backpackers. I found one on top of a restaurant, it was on GMaps, but I can\u0026rsquo;t find it anymore. It was held by a nice lady.\nSaw some people shitting in the streets in the middle of everything 🤮\nKenya Day 19 Mombasa Explore Fort Jesus, the Old Town\u0026rsquo;s narrow lanes, eat Swahili street food, see the thousands bats, the sculptures\u0026hellip;\nBut don\u0026rsquo;t take pictures of the government building, even though they are very Heritage, it\u0026rsquo;s forbidden.\nDay 20 Road to Nairobi Take the SGR train to Nairobi (6 h).\nBut be warned, the station security is airport like and it\u0026rsquo;s 10km out of town.\nPrepare to be there early!\nModern, air-conditioned, surprisingly punctual\u0026hellip; Relax and enjoy the scenery and the modernity.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re lucky, you can spot wildlife from your window, especially elephants, girafes and zebras.\nDay 21 Nairobi Arrive and get used to the city again.\nWalk around the center and see the National Museum.\nCareful, they will make you pay twice if you don\u0026rsquo;t pay attention, they took my card, swiped it twice, I got charged twice. They threw the other receipt in the bin, bunch of loosers.\nI slept at the YHA, it was full of weirdos and fanatics.\nThe streets were littered with people drugged out of their minds and some people tried to rob me. A lot of street harassment too\u0026hellip;\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re brave, visit. If you aren\u0026rsquo;t avoid.\nDay 22 Nairobi2 Book a half-day tour to Nairobi National Park, it\u0026rsquo;s right outside the city.\nOr see the giraffe mansion, the Karen Blixen Museum or whatever floats your boat.\nDay trips to the national parks outside of the Nairobi NP are crazy expansive. The Hell\u0026rsquo;s gate NP is like 150€+ for a day. Jesus Heckin\u0026rsquo; Christ.\nSpend the late afternoon preparing for the long road to Uganda. I took a night bus.\nUganda Day 23 Road to Kampala Bus north through the Busia border (12h +).\nDo take a night bus, it\u0026rsquo;s better.\nArrive in Kampala in the afternoon, visit the Gaddafi Mosque near the bus station or go to your hotel and visit whatever you want. It depends on your energy.\nKampala is crazy busy. Taking motorbike rides is especially crazy, no wonder there are a lot of road accidents and death. They call them boda-bodas here. But sometimes, I still say Tuk-Tuk.\nDay 24 Kampala Two options: Go to Jinja for rafting. Or, like me, visit the city a bit more in depth. I went to the Kasubi tombs, I checked viewpoints, ate some rolled eggs, saw the Hindu temple, rode Boda bodas at my life\u0026rsquo;s peril\u0026hellip;\nThe city is chaotic but friendly, but walking is suicidal.\nDay 25 Road to Fort Portal Early departure west (7–8 h).\nFort Portal is green, with views of the Rwenzori Mountains.\nThere isn\u0026rsquo;t much to see, so I ate and went further in the mountains, through a road in construction to get to my hostel.\nDay 26 Rwenzori Mountains Trek or hike shorter routes near the base.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re not climbing fully, there are beautiful day trails around Ruboni Village. Otherwise, try to get to a good altitude to see the unique plants.\nDay 27 Rwenzori Mountains Second day of hiking. You can sleep in one of the lodge then go higher to see the plants and stuff! Honestly, it\u0026rsquo;s one of the prettiest part of Eaast Africa.\nRwenzoris means moon mountains.

It depends on your energy.\nKampala is crazy busy. Taking motorbike rides is especially crazy, no wonder there are a lot of road accidents and death. They call them boda-bodas here. But sometimes, I still say Tuk-Tuk.\nDay 2 Kampala Two options: Go to Jinja for rafting. Or, like me, visit the city a bit more in depth. I went to the Kasubi tombs, I checked viewpoints, ate some rolled eggs, saw the Hindu temple, rode Boda bodas at my life\u0026rsquo;s peril\u0026hellip;\nThe city is chaotic but friendly, but walking is suicidal.\nDay 3 Road to Fort Portal Early departure west (7–8 h).\nFort Portal is green, with views of the Rwenzori Mountains.\nThere isn\u0026rsquo;t much to see, so I ate and went further in the mountains, through a road in construction to get to my hostel.\nDay 4 Rwenzori Mountains Trek or hike shorter routes near the base.\nIf you’re not climbing fully, there are beautiful day trails around Ruboni Village. Otherwise, try to get to a good altitude to see the unique plants.\nDay 5 Rwenzori Mountains Second day of hiking. You can sleep in one of the lodge then go higher to see the plants and stuff!

Do click on the links (destination name) to learn more!\nTanzania Day 1 Arrival in Arusha Most travelers land at Kilimanjaro Airport and reach Arusha by shuttle, some cross the border from Kenya (There are border transfer services, it last around 6 hours and it was an easy border. Be prepared to have a lot of people selling you stuff) And other takes a long bus from Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania\u0026rsquo;s capital. Apparently it\u0026rsquo;s a gruesome 10 hours. Otherwise, it\u0026rsquo;s a bit less than 3 hours from Moshi.\nI actually came by land from Moyale in Ethiopia. It took me two days and a half, in retrospect, that was a stupid move. (For those interested (???) I went Konso -\u0026gt; Yabelo -\u0026gt; Moyale -\u0026gt; Slept at the border -\u0026gt; Marsabit -\u0026gt; Nairobi -\u0026gt; Slept in the streets -\u0026gt; Arusha) I saw a lot of landscapes along the way and did encounter funny people, strange locals and saw tribes out and about, it\u0026rsquo;s part of the adventure.\nAnyway, use the afternoon to get oriented, withdraw a good amount of cash, VERY IMPORTANT TO DO buy a local SIM (Vodacom or Airtel), and check a few safari agencies. I like to do my \u0026ldquo;shopping\u0026rdquo; with local agencies, even though prices are pretty much aligned.\nMore tips here (I\u0026rsquo;m lazy, I won\u0026rsquo;t C-Paste my content): Tips for Cheap Safaris. Join a group with a local operator: it\u0026rsquo;s easy to arrange last minute, and you can get three-days safaris under 500€.\nArusha isn\u0026rsquo;t the prettiest city, there aren\u0026rsquo;t a lot of sights: a few Hindu temples, gardens and a couple of art centers; I\u0026rsquo;d say that it\u0026rsquo;s more than enough for an afternoon.\nWelcome to Africa btw.\nDay 2 Arusha – Safari (Tarangire) I went on a three days safari with the local agency linked to the Arusha Backpackers hostel, (I don\u0026rsquo;t remember the name), A Tunisian guy, Bessa - owner of the first hostel in Tunis helped me, out with the negociations. It\u0026rsquo;s always better negociating with a friend.\nSafaris starts early. Expect a long drive into Tarangire, a forested area famous for its elephants (see the picture). The day was kinda long, but it was a blast, very reminescent of Thoiry back home (it\u0026rsquo;s a drive-in Zoo). It was my first real safari and that was really exciting, I was beaming!\nYour guide will help you spot all the wildlife, but they will normally remain pretty far from the animals, especially if they are a licensed guide that respect this very same wildlife.\nI slept in a tent in a camp, where I listened to Jambo Bwana for the first time. It was fun and simple.\nThe big five can be spotted right from the first day, if ya lucky\nDay 3 Arusha – Safari (Ngorongoro) Wake up before sunrise to enter the Ngorongoro Crater.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a long descent into a massive bowl of wildlife, in the coldest of morning. When I went it was overly misty: Visibility was shit. The first few hours were rough and we missed the migration by weeks, changes in weather patterns messed things up\u0026hellip;\nSee the picture for the view/weather. Not that bad, actually, right? We spotted wildlife every 5 minutes or something, it felt like a railshooter. Anyone played Pokemon Snap before? That\u0026rsquo;s the feeling.\nWe camped near the Crater\u0026rsquo;s rim. You can hear the animals at night, noice.\nFact: Technically, the Ngorongoro is part of the Serengeti, even though it\u0026rsquo;s a different NP\nFact 2: The name is supposedly the sound of a bell\nDay 4 Arusha – Safari (Manyara) Final day of my safari, visiting Lake Manyara National Park.\nFewer crowds and good birdlife + Monke. It was my less favorite. I got tired after the first few hours. Safaris are not for me, they get exhausting after a while/\nManyara is home to the tree climbing lions, have fun trying to spot them!\nDay 5 Road to Moshi In the morning, I went to see the waterfalls near Arusha. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t worth it, folks try to make you pay every half hour and they are boring. So\u0026hellip; Take a morning bus or shared minivan to Moshi (2–3 h).\nThey are easy to find near the main bus station in Arusha, people will propose you the bus even if you don\u0026rsquo;t ask anyway.\nThe town of Moshi sits at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro. That\u0026rsquo;s the target. If you\u0026rsquo;re lucky, you might see it in its full glory.\nI went in the later afternoon, it was a hard mistake. Always arrive at your destination during day time.\nStory time: I came at night, had no sim card (I forgot) and my hostel (Mad Vervet Moshi) was a junkie nest where someone kidnapped me and forcefully brought me to an hotel with naked guys. So\u0026hellip; Avoid, be careful, don\u0026rsquo;t go alone. Be safe. This is no joke.\nDay 6 Moshi Shaken by the event of the day before I just went on a half-day hike around Materuni Falls, at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro.\nI met a nice man, that helped me immensely and spent time with his family. A nice \u0026ldquo;tuk-tuk\u0026rdquo; driver with a heart of Gold. I also switched hotel and found a safer place.\nStory time 2: I had been with the police the night before. Had a contact with them, but they were off. In a restaurant, far from the crime, Another policeman talked to me, heard about the case, gave me his phone number and all. Said it was just in case, to keep me safe, as the police deals in dark trades. Actually, he just wanted to you-know-what. I had to block him due to the almost nude pictures of himself he sent me. Thrice. He called with different numbers and tried to find me in the city.\nDay 7 Road to Lushoto I took a bus, early in the morning, trying to escape the dense gay policeman.\nIt was a long ride (6–7 h) through the mountains toward Lushoto in the Usambara Hills.\nThat part of my trip is blurry. I can\u0026rsquo;t recall much. I slept in a new hostel by the road, a bit higher than the town. A man named Emanuel and his family settled there and do honey keeping. I shared meals with them as well as watch a few show on the local TV.\nDay 8 Lushoto A view of Lushoto from the heights\nI Spent the day hiking to the Irente Viewpoint. The trail was nice, going through nature fror some bits and through local villages with nice kids greeting you at every opportunity. All of this was still a blur for me.\nDay 9 Road to Zanzibar Dar-Es-Salaam seen from the dock\nI caught a morning bus toward Dar es Salaam (6 hours?), then the ferry to Zanzibar (2 hours?).\nTo get the bus, I asked Emmanuel, the hostel owner to call the company and they picked me up in front of the hostel. It was super late and took forever to reach Dar, more than it was supposed to. I arrived around 3:30/4:00 PM and caught a ferry by taking a motorbike from the first bus station, I was scared of being late\u0026hellip; But, I made it in time, with half an hour of earliness to validate my ticket and everything.\nCareful at the docks, there are many places selling fake tickets, hundreds of scammers and weirdoes. I had to fight my way through, it was physical.\nThe trip is relaxing and comfy, the waves hadn\u0026rsquo;t started yet. Expect to arrive by evening to visit the beautiful Stone Town after dark; it\u0026rsquo;s safer and lively.\nDay 10 Stone Town The dispensary in Old town, it\u0026rsquo;s a medical center\nExplore the maze of Stone Town by daylight: the Old Fort, the markets, and the sea promenade.\nI ate at Forodhani Gardens, where locals grill food every night, it\u0026rsquo;s overrated. For lunch I went to a local shop and had much better food. Small hole in the wall without a name. Ate there for most meals afterwards.\nI recommend seeing the Jail for some hardcore history, the fort to see the activities (it\u0026rsquo;s lively), the palaces, eventually Freddy Mercury house, and\u0026hellip; just enjoy!\nI liked Stone Town quite a bit.\nI saw the sellers in the famous market shit behind their stall, close to the merchandise 🤮\nDay 11 Prison Island and Beach For the beach lovers\nTake a boat/tour to Prison Island to see the giant tortoises and the jail then spend the afternoon on one of the nearby sandbanks or beaches.\nI found a local agency at the fort with good tours, they were a blast to speak with (Jambo tour or smth like that) and where neatly organized.\n(If you want more comfort and relaxation, base yourself in Nungwi or Paje for the next days. I heard good things, except for the male prostitutes)\nDay 12 Spice Tour Join a spice tour inland! I went with the same tour company as the day before. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit touristy, but worth it for the smells and samples (Plus, I was alone, so I had my very own private tour to the farm) That\u0026rsquo;s a good half day spent for something important.\nIn the evening, hop on a small dhow boat for sunset and/or return to Dar. I did the later as my bus left very early.\nDay 13 Road to Kilwa Masoko Ferry back to Dar, then catch a southbound bus (8–9 h) toward Kilwa Masoko.\nThere were two bus to Kilwa: One leaves at 5:30, the other at noon. There might be other companies, but I have no intel on those. To get the bus I mototaxied to the station Mbagala Rangi Tatu and caught the bus at 7AM (Might have been late). At the bus station, there were those balls snacks that the Malagasy often make, it\u0026rsquo;s bloody delicious!\nThe road was long and without any major sight, everything looked the same until the azure coast. Onward it\u0026rsquo;s just villages, with a lovely pace of life.\nAfter a long time I reached the hostel: The Slow Leopard. Absolutely amazing quality! They also have another location in Dar, I definitely recommend it.\nI spent the evening relaxing and shopping for tours to Kilwa Kisiwani. I ended up going with the tourism information center, this was the most obvious choice.\nDay 14 Kilwa Kisiwani I\u0026rsquo;m bad at taking pictures, and the sun wasn\u0026rsquo;t nice to me.\nVisit the Kilwa Kisiwani ruins: once a major Swahili trading port and a World Wonder in Sid Meier\u0026rsquo;s Civilization VI. Yes, that\u0026rsquo;s why I went.\nWe got a boat for two (I met a scientist along the way) We were only two tourists!\nIt\u0026rsquo;s calm, scenic and pictures can\u0026rsquo;t do it justice\u0026hellip; It was expensive, quite a detour and exhausting, but I don\u0026rsquo;t regret it.\nDay 15 Kilwa Kivanje I visited the nearby Kilwas with the guide from the tourism bureau. It\u0026rsquo;s not particularily interesting, but I was a much cheaper visit and it was relaxing. I then spent the evening relaxing at the beach. You\u0026rsquo;ll need that before continuing your way south to Mozambique or back north to Kenya.\nDay 16 Back to Dar es Salaam Return north (6–7 h).\nIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t yet, explore Dar-Es-Salam a bit. I didn\u0026rsquo;t really like the city, it had no soul. But I had to waste a day here (So two days of transport wasted to See Kilwa, do what you want)\nDar is known for being a bit unsafe, be careful if visiting alone\nDay 17 Bagamoyo Short bus from Dar (1h 30 min).\nBagamoyo is a small coastal town with colonial buildings, it\u0026rsquo;s like Lamu or Tanga: A typical Swahili coast city.\nA quiet final stop before crossing into Kenya and a good way to slightly break the trip. To sleep, either: In Bagamoyo, back to Dar, or in Tanga, a bit more north.\nComments?

If you\u0026rsquo;re static, you will get cold. The winter season is less windy than summer\u0026rsquo;s, meaning that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel that cold.\nHostels Argentina is ok It\u0026rsquo;s difficult to find hostels in Puerto Natales, Chile I found one room in a house, with a broken window, my phone froze\nHotels are expensive Airbns were not common (And expensive too) Restaurants were not that better, many were closed down, but grocery stores were open\nCooking is a valid solution Camping is not.\nTransportation Only one or two buses a day run from Punta Arenas to Puerto Natales, they are slow and departs a bit late in the morning. They take about 3–4 hours and often leave late\nTranscountry buses run from Puerto Natales (once a day), going to El calafate, through El Turbio\u0026rsquo;s border.\nThey are easily full, do book in advance if possible. I asked my place for help\nEverything takes quite a bit of time, allow yourself enough travel days.\nMy ratio travel/transport wasn\u0026rsquo;t the best. With more days, I would have moved less and hiked more, like El Chalten\nIn Chile, check Bus Sur or Buses Fernández. In Argentina, look for Marga Taqsa, Cal Tur, or Taqsa Patagonia. El Chaltén can be reached from El Calafate even in winter, but buses are limited — usually every two or three days. I booked a tour\nThe border crossings are fine but slow down considerably the trips, count one to two hours to cross a border. Between Chile and Argentina, I had to wait one hour for someone to come to scan the passports.\nPro tip: Always confirm return times directly at the terminal. Online info is outdated half the time.\nActivities Hiking Torres del Paine is doable, without any special gear, as a day hike.\nSee the snow!\nTorres del paine is wonderful The Perito moreno is at its best El Chalten might be hard to see, but hiking is possible Many tours, mostly by cars wit small groups run around, shop in town All the museums should be open No penguins near Punta Arenas Antarctica is off limit in winter And that\u0026rsquo;s it!\nBring warm clothes, plan ahead for hotels and transportation\nComments?
